#### I. Introduction to Emotion

##### Definition of Emotion
- Complex psychological and physiological experience
- Involves multiple response systems
- Evolved to support survival and adaptability

##### Components of Emotional Experience

###### Conscious Experience
- Self-report
- Cognitive interpretation
- Subjective feeling state (e.g., "I'm scared")

###### Expressive Behavior
- Facial expressions
- Body posture
- Gestures
- Tone of voice
- Eye contact

###### Physiological Changes

**Central Nervous System**
- EEG changes
- Neural circuit activation

**Autonomic Nervous System**
- Increased heart rate
- Skin conductance changes

**Somato-Motor System**
- Increased muscle tone
- Physical bodily responses

**Endocrine System**
- Hormonal changes (e.g., adrenaline increase)

##### Evolutionary Function
- Highest-level expression of bioregulatory system
- Supports individual and species survival
- Helps organize body's response to environmental challenges
- Enables effective adaptation to different situations

##### Key Characteristics
- Emotions represent a complex interaction between cognitive, physiological, and behavioral processes
- They provide rapid assessment of environmental stimuli
- Serve as a critical mechanism for survival and social interaction

#### II. Theoretical Perspectives on Emotions

##### Dimensional Perspective
- Focuses on fundamental emotional dimensions
- Key dimensions:
  1. Activation (Arousal)
     - Measures degree of motivational activation
  2. Valence 
     - Reflects pleasantness/unpleasantness
     - Determines appetitive or defensive motivation

![[CBaSD - Theoretical Perspectives on Emotions 2 - image.png]]
###### Core Characteristics
- No distinct emotional categories
- Emotions created by combining these two dimensions
- Provides a continuous spectrum of emotional experiences

##### Categorical Perspective
- Each emotion corresponds to a unique profile
- Involves:
  - Subjective experience
  - Physiological responses
  - Behavioral characteristics

###### Evolutionary Approach
- 6-7 emotional categories evolved with specific functions
- Designed to support individual and species survival

##### Integrative Perspective
- Bridges dimensional and categorical approaches
- Hypothesis: Discrete emotions represent combinations of:
  - Arousal levels
  - Valence characteristics

###### Practical Implications
- Recognizes emotions as complex, multidimensional experiences
- Allows for nuanced understanding of emotional processes
- Supports both psychological and neurobiological research frameworks

##### Emotional Dimensions Visualization
- Low Arousal, Pleasant: Calm, contentment
- High Arousal, Pleasant: Excitement, joy
- Low Arousal, Unpleasant: Sadness, depression
- High Arousal, Unpleasant: Fear, anger

#### III. Physiological Basis of Emotions

##### A. Theoretical Perspectives on Physiological Reactions

###### 1. James-Lange Theory (Early 1900s)
- Physiological reactions initiate emotions
- Body's reactions cause emotional experience
- Example: Heart racing leads to feeling fear

**Criticism:**
- Physical reactions not necessarily interconnected with emotions
- Similar physiological responses for different emotions
- Emotional experiences can occur without clear physiological triggers

###### 2. Cannon-Bard Theory
- Emotional and physiological reactions occur simultaneously
- Thalamus plays crucial role
- Dorsal thalamus responsible for emotional feeling
- Hypothalamus responsible for physiological expression

**Criticism:**
- Overemphasizes thalamus's role
- Ignores complex brain processes

###### 3. Schachter-Singer Two-Factor Theory
- Combines physiological arousal and cognitive processes
- Cognitive labels important for interpreting emotional responses
- Same arousal can be perceived differently based on context

**Criticism:**
- Emotional responses can occur faster than physiological reactions

###### 4. RECAP and Difference between James-Lange and Schachter-Singer theories of Emotion

![[CBaSD - theorie of emotion recap - image.png]]
##### B. Facial Feedback Hypothesis
- Facial expressions connected to emotional states
- Muscles and expressions can affect emotional experience
- Experimental evidence:
  - Strack's pen-in-mouth experiment (1988)
  - Botox studies showing reduced emotional brain activity

##### C. Key Physiological Components
- Central Nervous System changes
- Autonomic Nervous System activation
- Somato-Motor System responses
- Endocrine System modifications

![[CBaSD - Key Physiological Components 1 - image.png]]
##### D. Physiological Emotional Responses
- Heart rate variations
- Muscle tension
- Skin conductance
- Hormonal changes (e.g., adrenaline)

**Key Insight:** Emotions involve complex neural circuits, not isolated brain regions.

   - Openness to change
3. Social awareness
   - Recognizing and anticipating others' needs
4. Relationship management
   - Guiding others' responses
   - Effective communication
   - Conflict management
   - Leadership

##### Measurement of Emotional Intelligence

###### Types of EQ Tests
1. Self-Report
   - Participants rate statements about themselves
2. Other-Report
   - Others evaluate the individual
3. Ability Tests
   - Similar to IQ tests
   - Measures emotional skills through various question types

##### Models of Emotional Intelligence

###### Mixed Models (Goleman, 1995)
- Personal and social characteristics
- Less specific but more communicative
- Focuses on:
  - Ability to motivate oneself
  - Persistence
  - Mood regulation
  - Empathy
  - Hope

###### Mental Ability Models (Salovey & Mayer, 1990, 1997)
- Cognitive processing of emotional information
- Key components:
  1. Perception and expression of emotions
   - Identifying emotions physically, mentally
   - Empathizing
   - Expressing emotions appropriately
  2. Understanding emotions
   - Labeling emotions
   - Interpreting emotional information
   - Recognizing complex emotions
  3. Conscious emotion management
   - Staying open to emotional experiences
   - Monitoring emotions
   - Managing emotions without repression

##### Practical Impact

###### Performance Correlation
- Top performers have 30% higher EQ than colleagues

#### V. Emotional Expression and Recognition

##### Facial Expressions

###### Cross-Cultural Studies (Ekman)
- Studied Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea
- Discovered universal facial expressions across cultures
- Identified initial set of universal emotions:
  - Amusement
  - Contempt
  - Contentment
  - Embarrassment
  - Excitement
  - Guilt
  - Pride
  - Relief
  - Satisfaction
  - Sensory pleasure
  - Shame

###### Micro-Expressions
- Definition: Full-face emotional expressions lasting a fraction of a second
- Characteristics:
  - Brief duration (about 1/4 of a second)
  - Can reveal hidden emotions
- Inhibition Hypothesis (Ekman, 2003):
  - Certain facial muscles activate during emotions
  - Cannot be fully inhibited, even when trying to hide them

##### Facial Action Coding System (FACS)

###### Technical Methodology
- High frame rate video analysis
- Slow-motion viewing of facial movements
- Purely descriptive, without emotional interpretation

###### Action Units (AUs)
- Smallest visually distinguishable facial movements
- Distribution:
  - 9 AUs in upper face
  - 18 AUs in lower face
- Each AU:
  - Unique verbal and numerical label
  - Linked to specific facial muscles

###### Key AUs for Specific Emotions
- Happiness: AUs 6 + 12
- Sadness: AUs 1 + 4 + 15
- Fear: AUs 1 + 2 + 4 or AU 20
- Anger: AU 23

##### Duchenne Smile
- Genuine smile involving:
  - Zygomatic Major Muscle (lifts mouth corners)
  - Orbicularis Oculi Muscle (elevates cheeks, creates "crow's feet")

##### Deception Detection through Facial Expressions
###### Challenges
- Complex to definitively link expressions to deception
- Face provides clues about hidden emotions

###### Cues of Truth and Lie

- Pupil dilation
- Tears
- Blushing/pallor/sweating
- Facial asymmetry
- Timing and placement in conversation

##### Research Insights
