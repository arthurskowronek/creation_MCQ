##### Importance of Customer Profiling

The fundamental principle behind customer profiling is:
"The more you know the customer, the better you can:

- Identifying vulnerable user groups
- Examples:
  - Potentially depressed users
  - Potentially aggressive users

###### Ethical Recommendation Challenges
- Research revealed recommender systems can:
  - Under-recommend positive content to depressed users
  - Over-recommend controversial content to aggressive users

- Trained on limited, biased dataset (Reddit content)
- Showed how training data dramatically influences AI perception
- Illustrated that algorithmic bias stems from data, not just algorithms

###### Key Insights
- Data used in machine learning critically determines AI behavior
- Same algorithm can produce radically different interpretations based on training data
- Importance of diverse, balanced training datasets

##### Ethical Implications
- Need for responsible AI development
