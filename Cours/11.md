#### I. Introduction to Intelligence

##### Definition and Core Concepts

Intelligence is a **psychological construct** (Johnson, 2013; Plomin, 2018; Sternberg, 2012) which can be defined as:
- An abstract, unobservable hypothetical entity
- Inferred from postulated thoughts and observable behaviors
- Represents patterns of psychologically related phenomena
- not something we can measure

In biological and psychological contexts, intelligence represents:
- The ability to manipulate one's environment
- The capacity to learn and understand
- The ability to adapt to novel situations

**Important note**: There is still wide disagreement among psychologists about the exact definition. Many simply accept an operational definition through measurement procedures.

##### Historical Context: The Beginning of Intelligence Testing

###### Binet's Pioneering Work (1904)
- Commissioned by the French Minister of Public Education
- Primary goal: Distinguish between:
  - Less capable students
  - More capable students
  - Capable but unmotivated students
- Created specific questions to measure intelligence-related abilities
- Developed problems to assess cognitive capabilities

###### Early Observations of Intelligence Variation

Two contrasting case studies demonstrate the range of intellectual capabilities:

1. Advanced Intelligence Example (A.H.):
   - Age 14 months: Could write own name
   - Age 2: Self-taught reading
   - Age 5: Reading encyclopedia independently
   - Age 10: Mastered high school algebra in 12 hours

2. Learning Difficulties Example (B.A.):
   - Age 10: Basic writing and counting only
   - Struggles with simple arithmetic
   - Unable to perform multiplication
   - Held back twice in school
   - Performance below 8-year-old peers

##### Key Understanding of Intelligence

Intelligence can be understood as:
- An inferred process
- Used to explain different degrees of adaptive success in people's behavior
- Initially focused on academic success
- Not based on any specific theory of intelligence
- Originally defined as "the ability to do well in school"

##### Evidence for Intelligence

The existence of intelligence is supported by psychometric research:
- Specialists measure psychological characteristics
- Use patterns of test scores
- Found evidence for:
  - General intelligence
  - Specific abilities
- Demonstrated through consistent correlations between different cognitive tasks

This understanding of intelligence formed the foundation for further theoretical developments and measurement approaches in the field of psychology.

#### II. Theoretical Approaches to Intelligence

##### A. Spearman's Psychometric Approach: Intelligence as a Single Trait

![[CBsD - Spearman's Psychometric Approach - image.png]]

###### Key Concept: "g" and "s" Factors
- Spearman discovered that performance on any mental ability test relies on two factors:
  - "g" (general intelligence factor): the dominant underlying ability
  - "s" (specific ability factors): lesser abilities unique to each task

###### Main Findings
- Good performance across cognitive tasks shows consistent positive correlation
- Excellence in one cognitive area often predicts good performance in others
- The "g" factor represents the area of overlap between all intelligent abilities
- Correlations between mental tasks are due to:
  1. Shared underlying processes
  2. These processes developing together, dependent on the same factor

*Note: Psychologists still debate what exactly "g" represents*

##### B. Cattell's View: Intelligence as Basic Abilities

###### 1. Fluid Intelligence
- Definition: Ability to think critically and flexibly in new situations
- Key characteristics:
  - Think on the spot and solve novel problems
  - Perceive relationships
  - Gain new types of knowledge
- Examples: 
  - Inventor creating a new vehicle
  - Critical thinking about solving fossil fuel use

###### 2. Crystallized Intelligence
- Definition: Individual's ability to use learned knowledge and experience
- Key characteristics:
  - Factual knowledge about the world
  - Skills already learned and practiced
  - Experience-based abilities
- Examples:
  - Memorizing countries
  - Knowing the alphabet
  - Remembering geometry proofs

###### Age-Related Patterns

![[CBsD - Age-Related Patterns - image.png]]

- Fluid Intelligence:
  - Peaks before age 20
  - Remains steady throughout life
  - Can be improved through training
- Crystallized Intelligence:
  - Continues to increase with age
  - Grows as long as people remain active and alert

9. Existential Intelligence
   - Understanding of life's big questions
   - Grasp of human condition

###### Important Consideration
Gardner's theory has led researchers to explore non-traditional aspects of intelligence, notably emotional intelligence, though there's ongoing debate about whether all valuable skills should be classified as forms of intelligence.


#### III. Measuring Intelligence

##### A. Intelligence Quotient (IQ)

###### Historical Development
- First intelligence test created by Binet and Simon
- Purpose: distinguish children's school performance capabilities
- William Stern coined "IQ" in 1912 (from German "intelligenz quotient")

###### IQ Calculation
- Formula: IQ = (Mental Age / Chronological Age) × 100
- Mental Age (MA): determined by testing multiple people in same age group
  - Baseline established by what 70% of participants can do at their age
- Chronological Age (CA): actual years lived
- Example: If mental age is 12 and chronological age is 10
  - IQ = 12/10 × 100 = 120

###### IQ Scale Interpretation
- 69 and under: Extremely low/mental disability
- 70-79: Borderline mental disability
- 80-89: Low average
- 90-114: Average intelligence
- 115-129: Above average
- 130-144: Moderately gifted
- 145-159: Highly gifted
- 160+: Superior/profoundly gifted

###### 3. Stability of IQ Scores
- Relatively stable from early childhood
- Variation decreases with age:
  - Age 4 to 17: ±13 points
  - Age 8 to 17: ±9 points
  - Age 12 to 17: ±7 points
- Scores tend to improve with:
  - Emphasis on academic achievement
  - Parental interest in academic success
  - Appropriate disciplinary procedures

This comprehensive section highlights the technical aspects of intelligence measurement, from basic concepts to specific testing methods and quality assessment procedures.

#### IV. Factors Influencing Intelligence

##### I. Overview of Major Influences
Intelligence is shaped by three main levels of influence:
- The Child's Individual Characteristics
- The Immediate Environment
- The Broader Society

##### II. Individual Characteristics

###### A. Gender Differences
- Overall IQ scores are virtually identical between boys and girls
- However, there are some specific differences:

**Girls tend to excel in:**
- Verbal fluency
- Writing abilities
- Perceptual speed
- These differences appear as early as toddler years

**Boys tend to excel in:**
- Visual-spatial processing
- Scientific reasoning
- Mathematical problem-solving
- These differences can be observed as early as age 3

*Note: Boys are over-represented at both extremes (very high and very low IQ scores)*

##### III. Environmental Factors

###### A. School Environment
- School attendance positively impacts intelligence
- Key findings:
  - During school year: Children from all socioeconomic backgrounds show comparable gains
  - During summer break: 
    - Low SES children: Show a drop in achievement scores
    - High SES children: Maintain or slightly improve scores
    
**Impact of Schooling:**
- More school days correlate with better achievement scores
- School attendance increases both:
  - IQ scores
  - Specific academic skills (reading, math)

###### B. Poverty Impact
- Strong correlation between poverty duration and IQ scores
- Key statistics:
  - Lower/working-class children score 10-15 points below middle-class peers
  - Wealth gap in a country correlates with IQ score differences

**Mechanisms through which poverty affects intelligence:**
1. Nutritional Factors:
   - Chronic inadequate diet can disrupt brain development
   - Even short-term poor nutrition can impair intellectual functioning

2. Access to Resources:
   - Reduced access to health services
   - Limited access to educational resources
   - Less exposure to enriching experiences

3. Environmental Factors:
   - Poor parenting conditions
   - Insufficient cognitive stimulation
   - Limited emotional support

##### IV. Stability of Intelligence

###### A. IQ Score Stability
- Intelligence shows relative stability from early childhood
- Test-retest reliability varies by age gap:
  - Age 4 to 17: ±13 points variation
  - Age 8 to 17: ±9 points variation
  - Age 12 to 17: ±7 points variation

###### B. Factors That Can Improve IQ Scores
Scores tend to increase when:
1. Academic achievement is emphasized as important
2. Parents actively engage in their children's academic success
3. Consistent but moderate disciplinary procedures are in place

##### V. Cultural Considerations
- Recognition of cultural bias in traditional IQ tests
- Development of culture-fair tests:
  - Example: Raven's Progressive Matrices
  - Designed to minimize language requirements
  - Focuses on abstract reasoning
  - Reduces specific cultural knowledge requirements

This comprehensive understanding of factors influencing intelligence highlights the complex interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental conditions, and societal factors in cognitive development.

#### V. Critical Issues and Modern Developments

##### A. The Dark Side of IQ Testing: Historical Misuse

###### 1. Virginia Case (1924)
- Implementation of mass sterilization programs targeting individuals with low IQ scores
- Based on the misguided belief that IQ was purely genetic and unchangeable
- Notable quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes:
  > "It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind."

###### 2. Nazi Germany
- Used IQ testing to justify sterilization of individuals with intellectual disabilities
- Part of their program to "purify" society
- Demonstrated how scientific concepts can be misused for discrimination

###### 3. Key Lessons
- Highlights the dangers of viewing IQ as a fixed, purely genetic trait
- Shows how scientific tools can be misappropriated to justify human rights violations
- Emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in intelligence testing

##### B. The Flynn Effect: Increasing Intelligence Over Time

###### 1. Definition and Observation
- Consistent increase in average IQ scores from generation to generation
- Dramatic comparison:
  - Early 20th-century individuals would score around 70 by today's standards
  - Modern individuals could score around 130 on early 20th-century tests

###### 2. Contributing Factors
1. Testing Improvements
   - Enhanced measurement tools
   - More accurate assessment methods

2. Environmental Factors
   - Better living conditions
   - Improved social environments
   - Enhanced cognitive development opportunities

3. Educational Advancement
   - Increased access to education
   - Better educational resources
   - More widespread schooling opportunities

4. Standard of Living
   - Higher overall living standards
   - Better nutrition
   - Improved healthcare
   - Greater access to intellectual stimulation

###### 3. Implications
- Suggests that IQ is not fixed but can be influenced by environmental factors
- Demonstrates the importance of societal development in cognitive enhancement
- Challenges purely genetic interpretations of intelligence
- Highlights the role of environmental enrichment in cognitive development

This section of the course demonstrates how our understanding and use of intelligence testing has evolved over time, from potentially harmful misapplications to more nuanced interpretations that consider both genetic and environmental factors. The Flynn Effect, in particular, provides strong evidence for the malleability of intelligence and the significant impact of environmental factors on cognitive development.

#### VI. Artificial Intelligence and Intelligence

##### A. Theoretical Perspectives

###### 1. Defining AI Intelligence
- **Chollet's View (2019)**
  - Need for updated definition of intelligence
  - Current definitions show human-centric biases
  - Turing test deemed insufficient
  - AI differs from human learning (e.g., cannot learn from few examples)
  - AI often uses shortcuts rather than human-like reasoning
###### 2. Key Definitions and Approaches
- **Legg & Hutter (2007)**: "Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals (skills) in a wide range of environments"
  - Criticized by Chollet for focusing on skills rather than generalizability
  
- **McCarthy's Definition**: "AI is the science and engineering of making machines do tasks they have never seen and have not been prepared for beforehand"

- **Minsky (1968)**: "AI is the science of making machines capable of performing tasks that would require intelligence if done by humans"

##### B. Evaluation of AI Intelligence

###### 1. Skill-Based Narrow AI Evaluation
- **Methods**:
  - Human Review (e.g., Turing test)
  - White-Box Analysis
  - Peer Confrontation
  - Benchmarks
- **Limitations**:
  - Only good at specific tasks
  - Hyperfocus
  - AI effect (focus on performance without considering method)
  - Anthropocentric bias

###### 2. Spectrum of Generalization
- **Levels of Generalization**:
  - System-centric (new to the system)
  - Developer-aware (new to system and developer)
  - Local Generalization (adaptation within fixed tasks)
  - Broad Generalization (adaptation to wide range of tasks)
  - Extreme Generalization (handling entirely novel tasks)
  - Universal Generalization (beyond human-relevant tasks)

###### 3. Measuring Broad Abilities
- **Key Principles**:
  - Reliability (reproducible results)
  - Validity (measuring intended qualities)
  - Standardization
  - Freedom from Bias
- **Integration with Psychometrics**:
  - Emphasis on abilities over specific skills
  - Use of broad task batteries
  - Importance of generalization assessment

##### C. Current State and Limitations

###### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Operational Mechanism**:
  - Based on next-word prediction
  - Uses pattern recognition on large datasets
  - Statistical analysis of word relationships

###### 2. Limitations and Criticisms
- **Key Issues**:
  - Described as "stochastic parrots" (Bender et al., 2021)
  - "Glorified cut and paste"
  - "Pastiche imitating style" (Marcus and Davis, 2020)
  - Lacks true comprehension and consciousness
  - Relies on statistical prediction rather than understanding

###### 3. Chollet's Summary Points
- Intelligence is about broad abilities and adaptability
- Measurement should control for experience and priors
- Focus should be on generalization strength
- Intelligence measurement must consider scope of application
- Proposed definition: "Intelligence is a measure of skill-acquisition efficiency over a scope of tasks, with respect to priors, experience, and generalization difficulty"

[[RP - On the measure of intelligence]]
[[RP - Centaur - A Foundation Model of Human Cognition]]
##### D. Future Developments
- Development of better evaluation methods
- Integration of psychological principles in AI assessment
- Need for balanced approach between skill-specific and general intelligence
- Ongoing research in improving generalization capabilities
- Continued exploration of the gap between statistical pattern recognition and true understanding
