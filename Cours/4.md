#### Introduction

```ad-question
title:How the world "out there" can be perceived, comprehended and acted upon by a set of neuros operating "in here"?
```

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Representations** : creation of the world made by cognitive and neural systems (phisical properties and abstract forms of knowledge)
```

- **Mental representation** = the sense in which properties of the outside world (e.g. colors, objects) are copied/simulated by cognition
- **Neural representation** = the way in which properties of the outside world manifest themselves in the neural signal (e.g. different spiking rates for different stimuli)

Not straightforward to link these two ideas. No one-to-one relationship between mental representation and response of a single neuron.

```ad-example
title:Single-cell recordings
```

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Single-cell recordings** : Measure the responsiveness of a neuron to a given stimulus (in terms of action potential per second).
- **Multi-cell recordings** : from 100 neurons
```

```ad-note
```

- Very small electrode implanted into axon (intracellular) or outside axon membrane (extracellular)
- Invasive : normally only on animals.
- Impossible to measure non-invasively (form scalp) : too weak + noise from other neurons.

#### Brain imaging techniques

##### Structural techniques

![[Structural techniques Brain imaging - image.png]]
###### Computerized tomography scan (CT SCAN)

![[Computerized tomography scan (CT SCAN) 1 - image.png]]

A CT scan creates 3D images of the inside of the human body. 
It works by using an energy source that emits a fan-shaped beam of X-rays through the body, while an X-ray detector on the opposite side captures multiple snapshots. 

These snapshots are taken as the machine rotates around the patient, and each rotation **creates a cross-sectional image, or slice, of the body**. The body is gradually moved through the scanner, **producing a series of slices** that are then compiled by a computer to form a detailed 3D image.

###### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

```ad-note
title:Advantages of MRI over CT
```

- Does not use ionizing radiation
- Better spatial resolution (e.g. folds of individual gyri)
- Better discrimination between white matter and gray matter

**An MRI machine works by using a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body.** 

- **Our bodies contain water**, and the hydrogen atoms in water **molecules act like tiny magnets sensitive to magnetic fields**. 
- When a patient is placed inside the MRI scanner, **the magnetic field causes the water molecules to align**. 
- Radio waves are then used to **make low-energy molecules absorb energy and change their alignment**. 
- When these molecules return to their original state, **they release energy, which the MRI detects.** 
- This data is processed by a computer to create a three-dimensional image of the body, allowing doctors to analyze specific organs or tissues for diagnosis.

title:Voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
**->** computational technique used to analyze brain images obtained through MRI scans
```

- Capitalized on the ability of structural MRI to detect differences between gray matter and white matter.
- Division in voxel.
- Measures white and gray matter density in each voxel.
- Can look for differences between groups or correlations with cognitive measures: If I learn a second language, will my gray matter density increase in some region ?

###### Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)

- Use MRI to measures white matter organization (connectivity) between brain region.
- based on limited diffusion of water molecules (H+) in axons

##### Functional techniques

![[Differences between functional techniques - image.png]]
###### Electroencephalography (EEG)

```ad-abstract
title:EEG
**EEG** records electrical signals spontaneously generated by the brain through electrodes placed on different positions on the scalp
```

| ![[Electroencephalography (EEG) 1 - image.png]] | ![[Electroencephalography (EEG) 2 - image.png]] |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
- Spontaneous and continuous electrical activity of billions of neurons recorded from the scalp.
- Summation of electrical potentials: Post synaptic potentials (PSPs): passive conduction.
- Large number of neurons must be active simultaneously and have a similar orientation.

```ad-attention
title:Not detecting the action potential, but the passive conduction ❤️ 
```

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Event-related potentials** (ERPs) : ERPs are electrophysiological changes elicited by particular stimuli (external or internal)
(Amplitudes: 0.1 – 10 µV)

- Represent the synchronized activity of a large number of neurons, extracted from EEG activity in relation to a particula event.
```

- Electrophysiological changes elicited by particular stimuli and cognitive tasks
- **Extracted using the averaging technique** (The procedure is based on the assumption that all EEG components not associated with the event vary randomly (noise)) :
	- The event must be repeated several times (30-50).
	- Average of a certain number of EEG segments (epochs) that include the event of interest.
	- Noise reduction is proportional to the square root of the number of stimulus repetitions

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Signal to Noise Ratio** (SNR) : A measure that describes the quality of the detected signal by comparing the amplitude of the signal of interest (e.g., brain activity) with that of background noise.
```

- **High SNR** = The signal is clearly distinguishable from the noise.
- **Low SNR** = The signal is covered or distorted by the noise


The ratio can be increased by averaging the EEG signal over many presentations of the stimulus : 

![[Signal to Noise Ratio - image.png]]

```ad-info
title:ERP Components Classification
```

- **Polarity** = Position relative to the electrical zero: positive (P) or negative (N) (ex : P300).
- **Latency** = The time interval (in milliseconds) from the presentation of the stimulus to the appearance of the deflection (ex : N100, P300).
	- It can vary significantly from one paradigm to another (ordinal position can be used, ex : N1, P3).
- **Distribution** = where on the scalp the component is most pronounced. Greater amplitude in certain areas of the scalp.

![[ERP Components Classification 1 - image.png]]

```ad-info
title:Analysis and quantification of ERPs :
```

| - *Amplitude* : the distance between the peak and the baseline or peak-to-peak<br>- *Latency* : the time interval between the onset of the stimulus and the peak<br>- *Area* or average amplitude within a time window (no visible peak) | ![[Analysis and quantification of ERPs - image.png]] |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
```ad-attention
```

In ERP, **different peaks may approximately reflect the functioning of different cognitive stages** (e.g. earlier peaks-encoding and later peaks-comparison).
But there is not a simple relationship between ERP peak and cognition, because each peak is a sum of different electrical activities

![[different peaks may reflect the functioning of different cognitive stages - image.png]]

```ad-seealso
title:Endogenous v. Exogenous
```

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Exogenous** or Early (<100 ms) = ERP components related to sensory stimuli (ex : size, intensity, sensory modality)
```

- **reflect the primary processing of the physical characteristics of the stimulus**, independent of its psychological meaning or instructions.
- are modality-specific and have a different scalp distribution (ex : Auditory or Visual characteristics of the stimulus)
- 50-60 msec

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Intermediate** (100-250 ms) = Still obligatory sensory responses elicited by external stimuli, strongly influenced by the physical parameters of the stimulus.
```

- P100 (**facilitation of processing**): early activation of the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli. It is sensitive to the mere presence of the stimulus.
- N100 (**visual discrimination & orientation**): selective attention processes
- Mismatch Negativity (MMN):
	- Elicited at around 200 ms by any discernible change in auditory stimulation
	- Reflects the automatic process of detecting the difference between an incoming stimulus and the sensory memory trace of the previous stimulus
	- Oddball paradigm: presentation of a series of identical stimuli (standard, 80%) and rare deviant stimuli (20%) that differ in intensity, frequency, or duration

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Endogenous** or late components (>250 ms) = ERP components related to the task (ex : what the participant is required to do). They are not directly influenced by the physical properties of the stimuli.
```

- P300 : Amplitude sensitive to probability of stimuli: info × (rarity + salience of stimulus)
- N400 : Elicited by semantically incongruent stimuli
	- larger for low-frequency words and metaphorically used words
	- difficulty of retrieving conceptual information associated with the word

```ad-example
```

The N170 is relatively specialized for faces

| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
![[Using ERP to Study Face Recognition 2 - image.png]]

```ad-example
title:Example: P300 and oddball paradigm
```

The oddball paradigm is an experimental design used within psychology research where the presentations of sequences of repetitive stimuli are infrequently interrupted by a deviant stimulus (target or oddball stimulus). The reaction of the participant to this "oddball" stimulus is recorded.

In ERP research it has been found that an event-related potential across the parieto-central area of the skull occurs around 300 ms after the presentation of the target stimulus.

The P300 wave only occurs if the subject is actively engaged in the task of detecting the targets.

Its amplitude varies with the improbability of the targets.

Its latency varies with the difficulty of discriminating the target stimulus from the standard stimuli.

The oddball paradigm is a commonly used task for cognitive and attention measurement in ERP studies. Studies of cognition often use an oddball paradigm to study effects of stimulus novelty and significance on information processing.

```ad-hint
title:SSVEP
```

**Steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)** are signals that are natural responses to visual stimulation at specific frequencies. When the retina is excited by a visual stimulus ranging from 3.5 Hz to 75 Hz, the brain generates an electrical activity at the same (or multiples of) frequency of the visual stimulus.

In other words, SSVEP are brain signals that occur in response to a visual stimulus flickering at a fixed frequency. A rhythmic stimulus can lead to brain activity in the **occipital lobe**, which is commonly associated with the visual cortex.

If done correctly, when a person looks at a target stimulus, the frequency of their neural activity will correlate with the frequency of the flickering stimulus.

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Associative priming** : RT are faster to a stimulus if that stimulus is preceded by a stimulus of similar meaning.
```

- **Gamma Waves** : sensory stimulation and memory consolidation - very active processs
- **Beta Waves** : active wakefulness (alert state), maximum amplitude in the frontal and precentral regions
- **Alpha Waves** : relaxed wakefulness - eyes closed, maximum amplitude in the occipito-parietal regions (disappearance → desynchronization)
- **Theta Waves** : falling asleep, hypnosis, meditation (common in children)
- **Delta Waves** : deep sleep

```ad-success
title:Advantages
```

- **Excellent temporal resolution** : 
	- Continuous measurement of the processing that occurs between stimulus and response
	- Ideal for determining which stage of processing is influenced by experimental manipulation or involved in a specific cognitive or emotional disorder
	- Useful for studying sensory processes, high-level cognitive processes, and motor processes
- **Measurement of implicit processing** :
	- Processing can be measured in real time, even without a behavioral response
- **Completely non-invasive** :
	- No restrictions on the amount of data that can be collected from a single subject
- **Relatively inexpensive** :
	- Large number of recordings = large experimental sample

```ad-failure
title:Disadvantages
```

- **Indeterminate spatial resolution**
- For ERPs, EEG **must be recorded in phase with a discrete event**
- **Low signal-to-noise ratio**
	- Requires a large number of trials for each condition
	- Highly sensitive to artifacts


###### Magnetoencephalography (MEG) - EEG 🦾💲

- Magnetic properties of neurons : Electric currents, including those generated by the brain, have an associated magnetic field that is potentially measurable.
- A whole-head MEG contains 200-300 superconducting quantum interference devices aka SQUIDs.
- The apparatus used requires extreme cooling (-270° C), using liquid helium, and isolation of the system in a magnetically shielded room.
- Results are quite similar to EEG. Also possible to record ERP

![[Magnetoencephalography (MEG) - image.png]]
###### Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

- Measures local blood flow (regional cerebral blood flow: rCBF)
- It **track a radioactive tracer injected into blood stream**
- Tracer takes up to 30 seconds to enter the brain, and further 30 sec to to peak to its maximum

![[Positron Emission Tomography (PET) - image.png]]

- slow temporal resolution: 30 sec
- excellent spatial resolution

###### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

fMRI is a technique for obtaining three dimensional images related to neural activity in the brain
fMRI **measures changes in brain blood flow** and **brain blood oxygenation** (hemodynamics) closely related to neural activity
- Active areas receive higher levels of oxygenated blood

```ad-question
title:How it's work ?
```

Applying a local magnetic field, it is possible to measure a distortion of the field related to presence of the deoxygenated hemoglobin. 
This is called **BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signal**

![[fMRI functionment - image.png]]

- The change in BOLD response over time is called the **hemodynamic response function** and it has a number of distinct phases 
- The Hemodynamic Response Function peaks in 6–8 seconds. This limits the temporal resolution of fMRI

![[fMRI work -image.png]]

fMRI has a **good spatial resolution** : 
- the intensity of the BOLD signal is recorded for very little portions of brain tissue (usually 2-4 mm3 or 1 mm3 )

![[fMRI voxel - image.png]]


```ad-note
```

- Use standard MRI equipment
- **Does not use radioactivity** : tested more times than PET
- No wait for peak
