#### Introduction to Attention

**Summary**: This part introduces attention, defining it as a cognitive process with limited capacity that selects information for further processing. It highlights attention's role in focusing on relevant stimuli while discarding irrelevant ones, setting the foundation for deeper exploration.

- focus on a particular object or idea at a particular time
- exclusion of other objects or ideas;
- is the process by which certain information is selected for further processing and other information is discarded
- **Limited capacity**
- Not necessarily same as eye fixation

#### Types of Attention

##### Selective Attention

- **Definition**: Selective attention is the ability to focus on specific stimuli in the environment while ignoring others.
- **Function**: Helps prioritize relevant information, which is crucial in managing cognitive load and making efficient use of limited attention resources.
- **Examples**:
    - **Inattentional Blindness**: Failing to notice unexpected objects or events in the visual field when focusing on another task (e.g., not seeing a person in a gorilla suit when counting basketball passes).
    - **Change Blindness**: Difficulty in detecting changes between visual scenes, particularly when those changes are introduced gradually or between distractions.

##### Sustained Attention

- **Definition**: The ability to maintain focused attention over a prolonged period, also known as "vigilance."
- **Stages of Sustained Attention**:
    1. **Start** - Initiating focus on a particular task or stimulus.
    2. **Continue** - Maintaining attention actively over time.
    3. **Stop** - Consciously ending the attention focus once the task is complete.
- **Purpose**: Essential in tasks requiring prolonged concentration, such as studying, reading, or watching a lecture.
- **Challenges**: Distractions, fatigue, and boredom can impede sustained attention, leading to lapses in focus.


##### Divided Attention

- **Definition**: The capacity to focus on multiple tasks simultaneously, commonly referred to as "multitasking."
- **Characteristics**:
    - Dividing attention across tasks can reduce the quality and depth of focus on any one task.
    - Often used in everyday activities, like listening to music while cooking or answering emails during a meeting.
- **Limitations**:
    - Divided attention is cognitively taxing and often leads to faster mental fatigue.
    - It’s generally less effective than focusing on tasks sequentially, as it reduces the efficiency and quality of performance across tasks.
- **Use Cases**: Divided attention should ideally be reserved for low-stakes or routine tasks where full concentration is not essential.

##### Alternating Attention

- **Definition**: The ability to switch focus between multiple tasks or stimuli, rather than focusing on multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Process**:
    - Alternating attention involves a quick shift in focus, which allows a person to manage different tasks in succession rather than simultaneously.
    - It requires mental flexibility, as one must disengage from one task to refocus on another.
- **Applications**:
    - Common in scenarios like taking notes during a lecture and then reviewing those notes to understand key points.
- **Benefits**:
    - While not as mentally taxing as divided attention, alternating attention still demands cognitive control and flexibility.
    - Helps manage complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable segments.


##### Summary of Key Points

- **Selective Attention** allows focus on a single stimulus by filtering out irrelevant information.
- **Sustained Attention** enables prolonged focus, essential for tasks requiring continuous mental engagement.
- **Divided Attention** involves multitasking but is generally less effective and should be minimized.
- **Alternating Attention** requires shifting focus between tasks, aiding flexibility in managing multiple responsibilities sequentially.

#### Mechanisms of Attention in the Brain

1. **Top-Down and Bottom-Up Processes**
    - **Summary**: Explores goal-oriented (top-down) and stimulus-driven (bottom-up) attentional mechanisms, detailing their roles and interactions in attention.
2. **Biased Competition Theory**
    - **Summary**: Introduces the theory that attention occurs through competition at multiple brain levels without a single dedicated module.

##### Top-Down and Bottom-Up Processes in Attention

- **Top-Down Attention**: This process is goal-directed, allowing us to focus on tasks based on intentions or objectives. It involves frontal regions that modulate attention by setting goals, which helps in concentrating on specific stimuli over others. For instance, when we intentionally search for a friend in a crowd, we use top-down attention.
- **Bottom-Up Attention**: This process is stimulus-driven, meaning our attention is captured by sudden, unexpected events. Examples include reacting to flashing lights or sudden movements, where the stimulus itself demands attention, independent of goals. This mechanism is crucial for survival, as it enables quick reactions to potential threats.
- **Frontal and Parietal Interplay**: Both types of attention rely on brain areas in the frontal and parietal regions. Frontal areas set goals (top-down), while parietal areas respond to sudden, salient stimuli (bottom-up).
- **The Rubber Hand Illusion**: This phenomenon provides a clear example of how both top-down and bottom-up processes interact. In this illusion, participants' attention is directed (top-down) to an artificial hand, while the simultaneous sensory stimuli (bottom-up) from the rubber hand being stroked lead to the illusion of ownership of that hand. The brain integrates these conflicting sensory inputs, highlighting the dynamic interaction between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory information.
	- Visual map (where the rubber hand is seen)
	- Tactile map (where the body is touched)
	- Proprioceptive map (the true location of the hand)
	-> Conflict between the maps and the brain has to decide “who to believe” : VISION WINS

##### Biased Competition Theory (Desimone & Duncan)

- **Overview**: The theory proposes that attention operates through a competitive selection process across multiple levels of the brain, without being localized to a single brain module.
- **Mechanism**: Competing stimuli are processed simultaneously but prioritized based on their relevance to the individual’s goals or their perceptual saliency. Stimuli are "biased" according to their importance or relevance, which influences the focus of attention. This can be seen in a scenario where multiple stimuli compete for visual processing, and attention is drawn to the most important stimulus in the given context.
- **Outcome**: Through biased competition, the brain optimally selects the most relevant information for conscious awareness and further processing, discarding less relevant data.
#### The Frontoparietal Network and Spatial Attention

1. **Role of the Parietal Lobes**
    - **Summary**: Examines how the parietal lobes help spatially locate objects and respond to behavioral saliency.
2. **Egocentric vs. Allocentric Spatial Awareness**
    - **Summary**: Explores how attention is oriented based on the observer's position (egocentric) or object-to-object relations (allocentric).

##### Role of the Parietal Lobes in Attention

- The parietal lobes, especially their posterior parts, play a critical role in attention by helping us locate objects in space.
- This region is crucial for directing eye movements toward salient stimuli—those that stand out due to sudden appearance, brightness, or importance.
- Parietal neurons are highly responsive to behavioral saliency rather than the mere presence of objects in the visual field, meaning they prioritize stimuli deemed behaviorally relevant.

##### Saliency Maps

- The brain uses "saliency maps" to identify and encode only the most relevant stimuli in the environment.
- These maps help the visual system prioritize attention based on the prominence of an object or event rather than simply its location in the receptive field.

##### Egocentric vs. Allocentric Spatial Awareness

- **Egocentric Space**: This type of spatial representation is based on the observer’s position. It determines the location of objects in relation to the body, such as “to my left” or “in front of me.”
- **Allocentric Space**: Unlike egocentric space, allocentric space does not depend on the observer's position but rather on the spatial relationship between objects themselves. For example, “the book is on the table to the left of the lamp.”
- The ability to shift between these two types of spatial references is essential for effective spatial navigation and orientation.

##### Spatial Awareness and the Right Parietal Lobe

- There is hemispheric asymmetry in spatial processing. The right parietal lobe has a more comprehensive representation of space, covering both the left and right spatial fields.
- Conversely, the left parietal lobe is more limited in scope, focusing mainly on the right spatial field.
- Damage to the right parietal lobe often leads to more severe spatial attention disorders than damage to the left side, as it affects awareness of the left side of space

![[Psy - space attention and parietal lobes - image.png]]
#### Disorders of Attention

1. **Neglect Syndrome**
    - **Summary**: Describes how right parietal damage causes spatial neglect, especially affecting left-space awareness.
2. **Other Disorders**
    - **Summary**: Details conditions like akinetopsia and optic ataxia, which affect movement perception and visual guidance.

##### Neglect Syndrome

Neglect syndrome, often resulting from damage to the right parietal lobe, is a spatial **awareness** disorder *(⚠️ can be in the test*) in which individuals fail to attend to one side of space—most commonly, the left side. Patients with this syndrome may have no trouble noticing stimuli on either side when cued, but they struggle to shift their attention from the unaffected side to the neglected side, creating an imbalance in spatial awareness.

The right parietal lobe plays a crucial role in spatial attention and is more specialized in representing space than the left parietal lobe. This means that right-sided damage causes more severe issues, particularly affecting awareness of the left space. Neglect can also reveal itself through **visual extinction**, where competing stimuli in the neglected field are often ignored when attention is focused elsewhere. Neglect is understood through **egocentric** (viewer-centered) and **allocentric** (object-centered) coordinates, with the disorder sometimes influencing the processing of spatial information based on the observer’s perspective or on object locations relative to each other.

Additionally, **imaginative or representational neglect** is a phenomenon where patients neglect one side of their mental imagery, as shown in studies like Bisiach and Luzzatti’s (1978) Milan Cathedral experiment, where patients only described half of the imaginary scene based on the side of their impairment.

![[Psy - neglect 2 - image.png]]

##### Other Disorders of Attention

- **Akinetopsia**: Also known as motion blindness, akinetopsia is a rare disorder characterized by the inability to perceive motion in a smooth, continuous manner. Patients experience the world as a series of static frames, which makes tasks involving moving objects extremely challenging.
- **Optic Ataxia**: This disorder involves difficulties with the visual guidance of hand movements, usually due to damage in the dorsal stream of the parietal lobe. People with optic ataxia can recognize objects but struggle to coordinate their reach or interaction with them, indicating a disconnect between visual perception and motor control.
- **Visual Agnosia**: Patients with visual agnosia can see objects but cannot recognize or make sense of them, as their perceptual understanding is impaired. This condition is not directly a disorder of attention but illustrates how object recognition can fail independently of basic visual processing, as some individuals can interact with or act upon objects they cannot consciously recognize.

Each of these disorders highlights the complex ways attention and spatial awareness interact with other cognitive processes, emphasizing the role of specific brain regions, especially within the parietal lobe, in facilitating coherent perception and interaction with the world around us.


#### Eye Tracking and Visual Attention

1. **Eye Movements as Attention Indicators**
    - **Summary**: Discusses how eye tracking reveals patterns of visual attention and focus areas based on gaze movement.
2. **Applications in Research and Marketing**
    - **Summary**: Highlights how eye tracking aids in fields like neuromarketing to gauge consumer attention and decision-making.

##### Eye Movements as Indicators of Attention

- **Eye Movements**: Eye movements are closely linked with attention, as where the eyes focus can indicate where attention is directed. By tracking gaze patterns, researchers can infer which objects or areas are receiving cognitive focus.
- **Types of Eye Movements**:
    - **Saccades**: Quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction. Saccades shift focus between points of interest but do not involve processing visual information during the movement itself. (The average duration of a saccade is between 20 and 40 ms)
![[Psy - eye tracking saccade - image.png]]
	- **Fixations**: Points where the eyes stop moving and focus on a specific element. During fixations, detailed visual processing occurs, which correlates with high attention levels. (Fixations typically ranges from 150 to 300 ms)
    - **Blink** : EBR can reliably predict individual differences in reward-driven behavior and cognitive flexibility (the average person blinks some 15-20 times per minute)
    - **Pupil diameter** : Depends of luminance, vigilance, cognitive-load, recognition of similar concept
- **Gaze Patterns and Cognitive Goals**: Eye tracking reveals that gaze patterns are influenced by the observer's goals. Rather than passively observing everything in a scene, the eyes are guided toward specific elements deemed relevant by the brain. Patterns differ between individuals and even within the same individual at different times or under different conditions.

##### Heat Maps in Eye Tracking

- **Heat Maps**: Eye tracking data can be visualized using heat maps, where areas receiving more visual attention appear warmer (e.g., in shades of red or orange).
    - **Static Heat Maps**: Useful for analyzing attention distribution on static media, such as print ads.
    - **Dynamic Heat Maps**: Applied in video formats, dynamic heat maps show attention distribution over time, helping to analyze engagement and focus shifts.

##### Applications of Eye Tracking in Research and Marketing

- **Fields Using Eye Tracking**: Eye tracking is a valuable tool across various fields including:
    - **Psychology and Neuroscience**: Helps understand cognitive processes by studying how attention is allocated visually.
    - **Psycholinguistics**: Used to study reading patterns and language processing.
    - **Neuromarketing**: Applied to analyze consumer attention to advertising and product displays, helping marketers determine optimal placements for key visuals.
- **Understanding Consumer Attention**:
    - **Visual Attention Analysis**: Eye tracking provides insights into which product features or advertisements attract the most attention. Patterns of gaze fixation can reveal consumer preferences and guide marketing strategies.
    - **Predicting Purchase Intent**: Studies have shown that eye tracking can be an effective predictor of purchase decisions, as consumers often fixate on familiar brands or items. Positioning well-known brands at eye level or on the right side of shelves can influence consumer behavior favorably.

##### Eye Tracking Technologies

- **Evolution of Eye Tracking Devices**: Eye tracking technology has advanced significantly, moving from early systems that required stabilizing devices (like bite bars) to portable, lightweight options that allow for more natural data collection.
    
- **Components of Modern Eye Trackers**:
    - **Infrared Emitters and Cameras**: Modern eye trackers use infrared LEDs that reflect off the eyes. The reflection is captured by cameras, allowing precise tracking of gaze direction.
![[Psy - eye tracker system- image.png]]
    - **Webcam-Based Eye Tracking**: Newer technologies allow eye tracking using standard webcams, making the technique more accessible for consumer research and other applications.
![[Psy - webcam eye tracker - image.png]]
- **Applications in Human-Computer Interaction**:
    - **Interface Design**: Eye tracking helps design user interfaces by showing how users visually interact with digital elements. Designers can optimize layout and functionality based on where users naturally focus.
    - **Assistive Communication Devices**: Eye-controlled devices, like tablets with gaze-based input, enable communication for individuals with disabilities, such as those with limited motor function
- **Detecting Autism and MCI**
	- **Detecting autism from visual exploration pattern of faces**: dentifying this lack of social engagement is a useful tool in early diagnosis. Autism: neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive, restricted, and inflexible patterns of behavior

#### Neuromarketing and Attention

1. **Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making**
    - **Summary**: Explores heuristics and biases impacting consumer behavior, highlighting the effects of framing and loss aversion.
2. **Attention Measurement Tools**
    - **Summary**: Describes methods like skin conductance and eye tracking, used to measure consumer responses to marketing stimuli.

##### Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making

Neuromarketing leverages insights into cognitive biases to understand consumer behavior, focusing on the unconscious, often irrational side of the mind. Key concepts include:

- **Heuristics**: Mental shortcuts that facilitate quick decision-making. Although useful, they sometimes lead to **cognitive biases**, or systematic errors in judgment.
- **Framing Effect**: The way information is presented significantly impacts perception and decision-making. For example, people react differently to information framed as a "gain" versus a "loss," even if the content is the same.
![[Psy - framming effect - image.png]]
- **Loss Aversion**: This bias shows that people prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, meaning that potential loss often weighs heavier in decision-making than potential benefits.

Understanding these biases is essential in neuromarketing, as it helps predict and influence consumer decisions.

##### Attention Measurement Tools

Neuromarketing employs various tools to capture implicit measures of attention and emotional response, which often outperform self-reported data:

- **Skin Conductance**: Measures arousal, or the intensity of the emotional response, providing real-time insights into consumer reactions. Higher skin conductance levels suggest a heightened response to stimuli.
- **Eye Tracking**: An invaluable tool in neuromarketing, eye tracking records gaze direction, fixation duration, and movement patterns. It reveals not only where consumers are looking but also how visual attention aligns with interest and engagement.

Eye tracking offers a non-invasive, precise, and implicit measure of attention, ideal for studying how consumers interact with visual content, such as advertisements or product placements.

##### Key Findings in Neuromarketing Using Eye Trackers

Research findings demonstrate that **visual attention** plays a crucial role in consumer choices:

- **Product Visibility**: Consumers often spend less than a second looking at products, making initial visual appeal essential. Consumers are drawn to familiar brands, with **brand recognition** increasing when positioned on the right side of a display.
- **Brand Loyalty**: When shopping, consumers’ visual attention often goes first to familiar brands, suggesting a strong correlation between eye movement and purchasing habits.
- **Visual Attention as Purchase Predictor**: Eye-tracking data reveal that visual attention is a strong indicator of purchase intent. The brand, particularly when strategically positioned, remains one of the most decisive factors in consumer choice.

This approach allows marketers to optimize product positioning and design, aligning visual appeal with consumer behavior patterns.

##### Practical Applications in Neuromarketing

In neuromarketing, attention measurement is instrumental in fields like:

- **Advertising**: Determines which elements capture attention most effectively, aiding in ad placement and design choices.
- **Product Design**: Eye tracking informs product and packaging design by identifying which attributes (color, shape, position) hold consumer attention.
- **Website Optimization**: Analysis of user gaze patterns helps improve web interface usability and optimize advertisement placement.

These insights support marketers in creating campaigns that resonate with consumer interests, optimizing engagement, and increasing conversion rates.


#### Attention Mechanisms in AI and Machine Learning

1. **Transformer Model Attention**
    - **Summary**: Explains the attention mechanism in AI models, specifically in transformers, to enhance text and image processing.
2. **Visual Attention in Image Tasks**
    - **Summary**: Discusses attention's role in image captioning models, focusing on selective processing of image features.

##### Transformer Model Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism in the [[Transformers]] model is a foundational element that enables the model to selectively focus on certain parts of an input sequence while generating an output. This attention function is critical to the success of modern [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] tasks, as it dynamically determines which elements of a sequence hold the most relevant information for the current step of processing.

- **Function**: Instead of processing an entire sequence uniformly, the attention mechanism assigns varying levels of importance, or "weights," to different sequence elements. This helps the model prioritize information that aligns best with the task at hand.
- **Self-Attention**: By allowing each word in a sentence to relate to other words in the sequence, self-attention captures context effectively, even for words that are far apart in the sequence. This aspect allows for parallel processing, avoiding the limitations of recurrent and convolutional layers and speeding up model training.
- **Components**:
    - **Keys, Queries, and Values**: These are representations of each sequence element. The model calculates attention weights by comparing keys and queries to decide which values (sequence elements) to prioritize.
    - **Weight Scaling**: The attention weights scale each element’s encoding, helping the model focus on more relevant portions of text as it encodes and decodes information.

##### Attention for Visual Tasks

In computer vision, attention mechanisms enhance tasks such as image captioning, object detection, and scene understanding by selectively emphasizing important visual information.

- **Image Captioning**: Attention mechanisms in image captioning models help determine which parts of an image should influence the generation of each word in a descriptive caption. This approach is essential for generating accurate, context-aware captions.
- **Selective Weighting**: The model can apply different weights across spatial regions in an image, prioritizing regions based on their relevance to the generated text. For example, when describing an image with a person and a background, the model can assign more focus to the person and less to less critical areas.
- **Feature Channels**: Attention also enhances specific visual features, such as color, shape, or texture, by adjusting the importance of individual channels within an image. This channel-based adjustment refines the model’s understanding of unique attributes within a scene, supporting nuanced tasks like fine-grained image classification.



In summary, attention mechanisms in AI, both in text and image contexts, allow models to concentrate processing power on the most relevant data points, boosting performance and efficiency across various machine learning tasks
