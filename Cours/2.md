#### Problem when we want to get information

```ad-note
title:Implicit VS Explicit information
```

It is known that **people often do not express their opinion clearly**, and sometimes they do not know clearly what they think.
- People may not say what is in their mind either **because they do not want to do it** (e.g., for social desirability) 
- or **because they are not aware of it** (self-deception).
The distinction between intention and capacity is like the difference between voluntarily hiding something from someone or unconsciously hiding it from yourself.

```ad-question
title: How can I have information from an individual avoiding the risks of self-deception or intentional hiding of the information?
```

**-> Using implicit techniques**

#### Some types of measures

##### Definitions of explicit and implicit measures

```ad-summary
title:Explicit measures
```

- They consist of **self-reports measures**, like questionnaires, surveys, scales, interviews, diaries…
- Through these measures, **people are directly asked to express themselves** about their attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors…
- These are the **most used instruments in psychology** (e.g., social psychology, personality) to study psychological attributes (attitudes, beliefs, personality traits…)

```ad-seealso
title:Scales
How many response options?
- **Odd is better than even** because it allows the person to express a neutral opinion, unless you want to force them to take a position
- It should be considered whether the topic under investigation is a potentially threatening or embarrassing one. In that case, it is better to provide a range of alternative answers.
```


```ad-abstract
title:Implicit measures
```

- They consist of **paradigms that make it possible to measure psychological attributes** (e.g., attitudes, stereotypes, self-esteem, etc.) **without requiring participants to directly report a subjective evaluation** of these attributes
- **Participants are not able to control their response**

##### Limits and advantages 

```ad-summary
title:Explicit measures
```

| ❌ Limits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ✅ Advantages                                                                                      |

| Sometimes people **do not want or are not able to provide accurate information** about their attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviours, etc. because of:<br>   -> distortion of the responses due to social desirability<br>   -> some psychological attributes are not consciously accessible | These measures are **easy to be implemented** and do not require too much time to be administered |

| These measures are **less easy to be implemented** and **require too much time to be administered** | -> People **do not require any introspection** for the evaluation of psychological attributes<br>-> **Participants are not able to control their responses** |
##### Example

**Problem :** We want to study the mental effort

**Explicit measure :** Likert Scale
The task was stressful :
- Strongly Agree
- Agree
- Neither agree nor disagree
- Disagree
- Strongly Disagree

**Implicit measure :** 
Pupil dilatation (the greater the cognitive effort, the greater the pupil dilation)

##### Definition of direct and indirect measures

```ad-summary
title:Direct measures
```

- The researcher **measures exactly the psychological attribute** that he/she wants to investigate
- People are **directly** asked to express their attitudes, feelings, behaviors etc. through self-reports measures (questionnaires, scales, interviews…)
- This imply that people are **aware** about which is the focus of the evaluation

```ad-summary
title:Indirect measures
```

- The researcher **collect another measure to infer the psychological attribute that he/she wants to investigate**
- People are **not directly asked** to express their attitudes, feelings, behaviors etc...
- This imply that people are **not aware** about which is the focus of the evaluation

```ad-attention
This definition does not say nothing about the controllability of the reponse.

The **main difference between an indirect and an implicit measure** is that **in the case of the indirect measure the subject can control**, at least partially, his/her response.
```

##### Come back to implicit measures

```ad-question
title:When a technique can be considered "implicit"?
When it is **indirect, unintentional, uncontrollable**

According to a broad definition, implicit techniques as those that **don’t rely on direct, deliberate, controlled or intentional self-reporting** (Nosek et. al (2011))
```

![[When a technique can be considered implicit - image.png]]

```ad-note
It is important to note that currently authors support the idea that **there is not a pure implicit measurement**, but there are **degrees of "implicitness" in measures**
```


#### The Implicit Association Test (IAT)

##### The concept of the test

```ad-success
title:Explanation of the concept
```

- The IAT was introduced in the scientific literature in 1998 by Anthony Greenwald, Debbie McGhee, and Jordan Schwartz.
- It allows researchers to **understand attitudes that cannot be measured through explicit self-report methods due to lack of awareness or social-desirability bias.**
- It is designed to **detect the strength of the automatic association between two mental representations** of objects (concepts).

```ad-question
title:How does it work ?
```

- The IAT sets the strength of the association between concepts **measuring the latency of responses (RT)**.
- It is **based on a phenomenon** of the central nervous system **called “compatibility effect”**: when two concepts are associated with each other in the mind of the subject and they share the same motor response (for example, they require the same key to answer) the reaction time will be very fast (this condition is called “congruent”); on the contrary, when two concepts are not associated in the mind but they share the same motor response (“incongruent condition”), the reaction time will become very slow.
- The **difference between the reaction time in the congruent and the reaction time in the incongruent condition, is called “IAT effect”**

```ad-question
title:What has to do the subject ?
```

- It is a computer-based test that **requires the subject rapidly to categorize the items** that appear in the central part of the computer screen according to two target categories.
- The **task of the participant is to classify the items**, as fast as possible and as accurately as possible, pushing one of the two keys available.
- The original test consists of 7 parts, called "blocks“, but to date the 5 blocks version is mostly used. The core of the IAT is constituted by the blocks 3 and 5. The faster between these two blocks, indicates in which way the concepts are associated in the subject’s brain

##### Application of IAT 

```ad-example
title:In marketing research
```

In marketing research, the IAT It is mainly use to **compare the preference between two brands** (target brand vs baseline brand)

![[Dissociation between Implicit and Explicit attitudes - image.png]]

The analysis of the "attitude change" revealed that **87% of the participants (n = 723) showed a dissociation between explicit and implicit attitude**, while only 106 participants maintained a coherence between implicit and explicit measure.

#### Priming

##### Definition

```ad-abstract
title:Definition of priming
It is a psychological effect where the **exposure to a stimulus influences the response to the subsequent stimuli**.

It consists in the activation or pre-activation of certain mental representations.
```

It is an **implicit paradigm** as the subject is not aware of the fact that a first stimulus (called “prime” stimulus) will facilitate the recognition of the second stimulus, so it cannot control the automatic response influenced by the prime.

```ad-note
It can be subliminal or supraliminal :
- **Subliminal** = the prime stimulus is captured by our brain but not processed (threshold = 15-30 ms), therefore it is not consciously perceived
- **Supraliminal** = the subject is aware of the prime stimulus (threshold > 15-30 ms)
```

##### Types of priming and effect

It can be of **different types** : Perceptual, Semantic, Associative, Repetition, Affective …

The priming effect **works best when the two stimuli** (the prime and the second stimulus) **are in the same sensory modality.** 

**For example :**
The visual priming works best with visual stimuli, the verbal priming with verbal stimuli...

However, the priming effect can also occur with stimuli presented in different modalities, or between words semantically related to each other.


```ad-abstract
title:Positive and negative priming
**Positive and negative priming :** the terms ’positive’ and ’negative’ priming refer to how the prime stimulus affects the processing speed of the second stimulus. 

A positive prime speeds up the processing, while a negative prime slows down the processing (if compared to the unprimed condition).
``` 

###### Perceptual and conceptual priming

```ad-abstract
title:Perceptual and conceptual priming
The difference between "perceptual" and "conceptual" priming is whether **items with a similar perceptual characteristic** or **items with a similar meaning**, respectively, **are primed.**
```

**-> Perceptual priming** is sensitive to the modality and of the stimulus. For example, a red primer will facilitate the processing of the following red stimulus.

**-> Conceptual priming** is based on the meaning of a stimulus. For example, the word ‘table’, will show priming effects on ‘chair’, because ‘table’ and ‘chair’ belong to the same conceptual category.

###### Semantic priming

```ad-abstract
title:Semantic priming
The prime and the target **are from the same semantic category** and share features.
```

For example, the word ‘dog’ is a semantic prime for ‘wolf’, because the two are similar animals.

![[Semantic priming - image.png]]

Even if they are not words, **morphemes can prime** for complete words that include them. 
An example of this would be that the morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'

![[Semantic priming 2 - image.png]]

###### Associative priming

```ad-abstract
title:Associative priming
In **associative priming**, the target is a word that has a high probability of appearing with the prime but they not necessarily semantically related.
```

"Dog" is an associative prime for "cat", since the words are closely associated and frequently appear together in sentences like "raining cats and dogs".

###### Context priming

A similar effect as the associate priming is known as **context priming**. 

```ad-abstract
title:Context priming
**Context priming** works by using a context to speed up processing for stimuli that are likely to occur in that context.
```

![[Context priming - image.png]]

###### Affective (or emotional) priming

```ad-abstract
title:Affective priming
**Emotional priming** is accomplished by presenting an emotionally laden word or image just before presenting the word or image that is to be affectively primed.
```

The exposure to an emotional stimulus (the "prime") influences the emotional response or behaviour toward a subsequent stimulus. The priming effect occurs because the initial emotional stimulus activates related emotional states or responses, which then carry over and affect the way the individual processes or reacts to new information.

**For example**, Power et al. (1991) used sets of words to activate the following emotions: 
- (a) happiness, love, joy, pleasure; 
- (b) sadness, grief, misery, depression; 
- (c) anger, hate, jealousy, aggression;  
- (d) fear, panic, terror, anxiety.

![[Emotional priming - image.png]]


A longer-lasting effect which is similar to affective priming is "**evaluative conditioning**".

Evaluative conditioning concerns **how we come to like or dislike something by way of associations**.

**Advertising frequently uses evaluative conditioning** to influence consumer behaviour 
*(e.g., associating a movie star or star athlete with a product by talking favourably about the product while using it or wearing it)*. 
In the same way, to associate a positive word or image to a product will influence the preference of the subject for that product

![[Affective priming 2 - image.png]]

###### Repetition priming

**Repetition priming**, also called direct priming, is a form of positive priming.
When a stimulus is experienced, it is also primed.
This means that later experiences of the stimulus will be processed more quickly by the brain.


#### Mental chronometry

##### Definition

```ad-abstract
title:Mental chronometry
**Mental chronometry** is the scientific study of cognitive processing speed.

- Processing speed is measured by **reaction time (RT)**, which is the elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus (e.g., visual or auditory) and an individual’s response.

- A RT is made by **two components** : **cognitive RT** (information perception and processing) + **motor RT** (motor response).

- RTs are measured in milliseconds (ms)
```

##### The Information Processing Approach

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
The **Information Processing Approach** in psychology is a cognitive framework used to understand how the human mind processes information.
```

It draws an **analogy between the mind and a computer**, where information is input, processed, stored, and retrieved. 
The brain is the hardware, and the mind is the software.

This approach studies the mental processes involved in perception, memory, decision-making, and problem-solving.

![[Information Processung Approach - image.png]]

```ad-note
Mental chronometry is one of the paradigms most used by the Information Processing Approach to study cognitive processes
```

By analysing how long it takes for an individual to respond to a stimulus (e.g., pressing a button after seeing a light), researchers can gain insights into the underlying cognitive operations and the time required for different stages of information processing

##### Mental chronometry basic assumptions

Mental chronometry basic assumptions:
1. **mental operations require time**
2. **greater the RT greater the elaboration of the information required by the task**

Tasks used in mental chronometric research are typically very simple, requiring a relatively small number of mental processes.

##### Donders subtractive method

It is considered one of the earliest attempts at using mental chronometry to analyse cognitive functions.

```ad-hint
title:Donders substractive method
**Donders’ method** is based on the idea that the **time required for a mental task can be divided into discrete stages** (e.g., stimulus perception, decision-making, response execution). 

-> The method works by **comparing the reaction times** (RTs) of different tasks that include the same stages but vary by one additional stage. 

-> By subtracting the reaction times of two tasks, Donders aimed to isolate the time taken by the additional mental stage.
```

```ad-example
title:Three tasks used by Donders
```

**1 - Simple Reaction Time Task (A-task) :**
The subject responds as soon as they detect a stimulus (e.g., pressing a button when a star appears). This task involves stimulus detection and response execution but no decision-making.

**2 - Choice Reaction Time Task (B-task) :** 
The subject responds differently depending on which stimulus appears (e.g., pressing right button for a yellow star and left for a blue star). This task involves stimulus detection, stimulus discrimination, response selection, and response execution.

**3 - Go/No-Go Reaction Time Task (C-task) :** 
The subject responds only if a specific stimulus appears (e.g., pressing a button for a yellow star, but doing nothing for a blue star). This task involves stimulus detection, stimulus discrimination, and response execution without response selection.

```ad-success
title:Application of the subtractive method
```

**Donders proposed that the total reaction time for each task consists of a series of stages.**

He then used the following approach to estimate the time required for each mental stage :
- **Stage 1 :** **Stimulus detection and response execution** — Measured by the simple reaction time task (A-task).
	- $RT_{A-task}$
	- *The average simple reaction time (RT) for humans, in response to a visual stimulus, is typically around 200 to 250 milliseconds (ms). Auditory information is processed more quickly, around 150–200 ms. RT for tactile stimuli typically fall between 130–180 ms.*
- **Stage 2 : Stimulus discrimination** — The time required for this process is estimated by subtracting the simple $RT_{A-task}$ from the Go/No-Go RT (C-task). This gives the time for discrimination.
	- $\text{Discrimination Time} = RT_{C-task} - RT_{A-task}$
- **Stage 3 : Response selection** — The time for response selection can be found by subtracting the Go/No-Go $RT_{C-task}$ from the choice $RT_{B-task}$, as the only difference between these tasks is the need for response selection.
	- $\text{Response Selection Time} = RT_{B-task} - RT_{C-task}$

##### Serial vs. Parallel processing

```ad-attention
```

**Early models (like the Donders method) assume that cognitive processes are strictly sequential and independent**, suggesting that processing occurs in a step-by-step, serial manner (one piece of information at a time).

But **more recent approaches suggest that the brain can also process multiple pieces of information simultaneously** (parallel processing).
