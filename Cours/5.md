#### How ML is relevant to brain disorders ?

**From group-level to individual-level inferences :**
- There are been impressive advances in the research of the neurobiological basis of brain disorders but there is a gap between research and clinical practice (group-level vs individual-level)

**From univariate to multivariate inferences :**
- Limitations of Traditional Methods in Studying Brain Disorders
	- Mass-univariate approaches:
		- Perform separate tests for each variable
		- Ignore potential interactions between brain regions
*Example : Neuroimaging*
- Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM): compares brain regions (voxel-wise) independently
- Fails to capture the network-level dynamics of the brain (e.g. no interaction between voxels)

Why This Is Problematic:
- Current understanding of brain function : Network-wide changes > localized alterations.
- Psychiatric and neurological symptoms : not isolated regions but by widespread changes in brain structure and function.

Solution: MACHINE LEARNING:
- inherently a multivariate approach: taking the relationship between multiple variables
- combine different types of data within the same model--> enhance prediction

**Focus on prediction and generalizability :**
- Classical Statistics :
	- Inferential statistics: relationship between observed phenomena*
	- Explanatory power ≠ Predictive power*
	- Models tailored to specific data are less generalizable to new data: overfitting
	- Small sample --> + risk of overfitting
- Machine Learning :
	- Main goal:
		- Maximize generalizability, not just explain the data.
		- Development of predictive models capable of generalizing to unseen data

**Data-driven models and big data :**
Classical research in brain disorders: deductive (top-down) or theory-driven approaches: Hyp, test, decision.

ML: bottom-up approach: “let the data speak for themselves,”while making as few assumptions as possible about the data

Despite big data being uncommon in brain disorders, the research community is recognizing its benefits, leading to more efforts. As investment in large datasets grows, machine learning is expected to gain momentum.
- bipolar disorder using data from 3020 participants (Nunes et al., 2018),
- schizophrenia with 941 individuals (Rozycki et al., 2018),
- AD with 20,000 participants (Wegmayr, Aitharaju, & Buhmann, 201

#### Different types of ML

![[type of ML - image.png]]

```ad-abstract
title:Supervised
The algorithm has prior knowledge of what the output values should be (e.g., patient with depression vs. healthy control)
```

Most clinical problems can be simplified into a categorical decision :
- diagnostic classification
- prognostic classification

#### Applications of ML to brain disorders

##### Prediction of illness onset

```ad-abstract
title:Prediction of illness onset
Studies attempting to predict whether people at clinical risk for a certain disease will or will not become ill in the futur
```

```ad-example
```

Predicting the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from mild cognitive impairment (emergence of selective memory deficits, MCI), which progresses to AD in only 40%-60% of patients within five year

**Neuroimaging data + Multimodal approaches :** 
51% to 80%: improved by integrating clinical, biological measures, or longitudinal information

Fewer studies have attempted to predict the onset of psychiatric disorders, e.g. from clinical high-risk of psychosis to a full-blown episode (84%, Koutsouleris et al., 2012) 52% and 84%: Review (Janssen et al., 2018

##### Diagnostic evaluation

```ad-abstract
title:Diagnostic evaluation
Studies attempting to develop biological or cognitive markers for detecting the presence or absence of a certain diseas
```

AD: 83% to 100%
multiple sclerosis: 86% to 96%
parkinsonisms: higher than 80%
mood disorders: 59% to 90%
schizophrenia: 57% to 95% -> **heterogeneity**: individuals with marginally overlapping clinical presentations may be given the same diagnos

##### Prediction of outcomes

```ad-abstract
title:Prediction of outcomes
Studies attempting to predict clinical outcomes in patients with a certain illness, for example, in terms of remission versus relapse
```

Patient with aphasia* after stroke
- ML applied to baseline resting-state functional MRI to predict language outcome at 6 months follow-up.
- Prediction: good vs. bad recovery (76%, Saur et al., 2010)

Predict the insurgence of dementia from the baseline brain scans of patients with Parkinson’s disease
- Clinical + Neuroimaging: predict cognitive impairment at 2 years follow-up (80%, Schrag, Siddiqui, Anastasiou, Wein traub, & Schott, 2017)

Course of the illness (i.e., continue/remitting):
- depression: moderate: 73% 78%
- psychosis: inconsistent: 52% 70%

Predict response to pharmacological therapies in mood disorders.
- discriminating: response and nonresponse (70%, Gong et al., 2011 to 89%, Liu et al., 2012), indicating contrasting result

#### The main challenges

```ad-question
title:What are the main challenges in machine learning studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders?
```
##### Absence of biomarkers

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Biomarker :** A characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention
```

**Neurological disorders :**
- the diagnosis is highly reliable, thanks to robust biomarkers that provide objective evidence

**Psychiatric disorders :**
- however, there are no reliable and robust biomarkers

##### Reliability of diagnosis

--> Neurological and psychiatric disorders are associated with different degrees of diagnostic reliability

**Neurological disorders:** 
- biomarkers --> minimal uncertainty

**Psychiatric disorders:** 
- no biomarkers + presence of clinical heterogeneity + high rates of comorbidit

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Inter-rater reliability :** degree to which two clinicians would independently agree on the presence or absence of a disorder when the same individual is assessed using the proposed diagnostic criteria. k statistic: 0-1.
```

![[Inter-rater reliability - image.png]]

```ad-attention
title:Problems
```

If the labeling of patients and controls in the training data is biased, i.e., the gold standard is unreliable, the training algorithm will **learn a biased classification**.

If the original diagnostic labels are unreliable, this will lead to **inaccurate estimation of the performance** of the machine learning algorithm

##### Heterogeneity

**Definition and Origins**: In psychiatric and neurological disorders, heterogeneity often arises from distinct sub-types of patients who each may exhibit unique neurobiological characteristics or variations in symptom presentation. This diversity can significantly impact machine learning studies, especially as it complicates identifying consistent patterns across patient data.

**Sample Size Considerations**:
**Small Sample Sizes**:
- With smaller datasets, it's common to apply strict exclusion criteria, yielding a more homogeneous sample of “ideal patients.”
- This approach reduces variability, leading to seemingly high accuracy but limits the algorithm’s ability to generalize, often resulting in **overoptimistic accuracy estimates** that don’t translate well to broader clinical settings.

**Larger Sample Sizes**:
- As sample sizes increase, criteria for inclusion often become less restrictive to better represent the full spectrum of clinical populations.
- This increases heterogeneity in the data, but it also enhances the study’s **translational potential**, making findings more applicable to real-world clinical practice.

#### How good is good enough ?

```ad-question
title:What level of performance should be achieved for a machine learning-based tool to be considered clinically useful?
```

The clinical utility of a diagnostic or prognostic tool mainly depends on two factors:
- the available alternatives
- the cost of misclassification

##### Available alternatives

- for a **biomarker** to be considered clinically useful, it must show an overall **accuracy of 80% or more**.
- clinically useful if it enables diagnostic or prognostic inferences with an accuracy that is similar or superior to standard methods

```ad-example
```

The current clinical criteria for diagnosing “probable Alzheimer” (i.e. Alzheimer not pathologically confirmed) provide a sensitivity of 85% when compared with autopsy-based cases. Thus, the sensitivity of ML algorithm should exceed 85% to be considered clinically useful (Savitz et al., 2013).

##### Cost of misclassification

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Sensitivity/Recall** (also called the true positive rate) measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition).
- **Specificity** (also called the true negative rate) measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition).
- **Diagnosis** : the cost of erroneously misclassifying someone ill as healthy may be higher than the cost of misclassifying someone healthy as ill
- **Prognostic tools** : inaccurate prognosis can lead to inefficient use of clinical resources, such as the administration of treatment that is not needed and may cause adverse side effects
```

##### Is ML ready ?

```ad-question
title:Is machine learning ready to be applied in psychiatry and neurology?
```

**Issue relates to how illness is conceptualized :**
- not only neurobiological alteration, but genetic and environments 
	--> interpretation of the output in light of patient’s clinical history and symptomatology.
- Better understanding of the generalizability of the models across the different diagnostic systems.
- Dimensional approach (continuum between health and illness, and across disorders)

```ad-info
title:Clinical tools
```

Machine learning-based tools are already available to researchers and clinicians :
- to support diagnostic rather than prognostic evaluation.
- Are validated on neurological diagnosis only.
- Are targeted towards biomarker that are relevant for a specific disorder
- Are validated on a small number of databases and individuals
- Tools are validated using a gold standard (i.e. visual inspection by human expert; manual delineation by human expert)
