#### The research process

The research process :

#### Example of research process

**Initial (casual) observation:** every year in TV reality shows (like the Big Brother) there are many participants with really unpleasant personalities

**Research question:** Why reality shows participants have unpleasant personalities?

**Possible theories:**
1) People with narcissistic personality disorder are more likely to audition for reality shows than those without.
2) The producers of reality shows are more likely to select people who have narcissistic personality disorder than people with a “low profile” personality.

**To test our theories, we need to collect more data, according to our hypothesis:**
1) The number of people who have a personality disorder and participate in the auditions is higher than the number of people who have a personality disorder in the general population (1%).
2) The number of people who have a personality disorder and who passed the final selections is higher than the number of people who have a personality disorder and participated in the auditions.

**How to test these hypothesis ?**
 -> Testing Hypothesis 1:
You need to collect the personality profile of people in the auditions (e.g., through personality questionnaire) and to calculate the % of people with a narcissistic disorder. Then, you have to compare this % with the general population rate (1%).

 -> Testing Hypothesis 2:
You need to count the % of participants who have a narcissistic disorder between who passed the final selection . Then, you have to compare this % with the rate calculated in hypothesis 1


#### Some definitions

To describe data, we can use :
- **Quantitative methods** : in form of numbers
- **Qualitative methods** : in other forms

A **research method** is : 
- the research design, or the structure of the research (identification of the variables, definition of the experimental groups)
- the technique used to measure the data

**Falsification** is the act of disproving a hypothesis or theory

The goal of the research is to determine the relationship between different variables, in particular between the independent and the dependent variable.
- **independant variables** : the variables manipulated by the experimenter ; the variables that we think is the cause of an effect ; it does not depend on any other variable ; using a predictive approach, independent variables are the predictors
- **dependant variables** : the variables that change according to the manipulation of the independent variables ; the variables that we think are affected by the manipulation of other variables ; Using a predictive approach, dependent variable is the outcome

```ad-danger
A relation between the independent and the dependent variable does not mean that there is a cause-effect connection!!! It can be just a **correlation**.
```

##### Type of research design

![[type of research design - image.png]]

**Not experimental design**
The experimenter doesn’t try to manipulate any variable (e.g., naturalistic observation (kids play))

**Quasi experimental design**
- The experimenter doesn’t have the control on some variables
- Some categories are pre-established (e.g., age, weight, height, gender, etc.)
- When the researcher cannot decide about the assignment of the participants to the different experimental conditions, we are in front of a quasi-experimental design

**Experimental design**
- The experimenter has the maximum control on all the variables (e.g., which kind of treatment is given to the patients, where the experiment takes place, when, etc.)
- The most important variable to control is the assignment of the participants in different experimental conditions: when the researcher can decide about the assignment of the participants to the different experimental conditions, we are in front of a full experimental design!

##### Type of group : Experimental group vs control group

- Each experiment requires at least two groups to compare.
- The two groups should be **identical** (same age, same % of male and female, same educational level, etc.) **except for the manipulated variable.**

**Experimental group**
It is the group that received the experimental manipulation

**Control group**
It is the group that did not received any experimental manipulation

##### Between vs within subjects experimental design

**Between subjects design**
- different groups of people take part in different experimental conditions
- it also called independant design
Example : Group 1 (3 coffee/day) Vs. Group 2 (no coffee)

**Within subjects design**
- the same group pf participants takes part in different experimental conditions
- it is also called repeated-measures design
Example : Week 1 (no coffee) Vs. Week 2 (3 coffee)

##### Cross-Sectional VS Longitudinal studies

- These studies have the purpose to investigate how a variable change during the time (e.g., according to the age of the subject).

For example, if I want to study how memory abilities change during the lifespan, you cannot directly manipulate the age of the participants.

So, what can you do?
1) Compare the memory of the same subjects in different time (20 years, 40 years, 60 years, 80 years) -> **Longitudinal studies** = the same subjects are studied during their life
2) Compare the memory of different subjects of different ages (a group of 20 years old people, a group of 40 years old people, a group of 60, and one of 80) -> **Cross-sectional studies** = different groups of subjects, who are in different periods of their life, are tested


Main problems of this kind of studies:
1) **Cohort effect** = different generations are different for education, lifestyle, economic status, etc., so they not differ only for the investigated variable (e.g., the memory) → cross-sectional studies
2) **Maturity effect** = During the entire life there are a lot of experience that can change the people. For example, participants who take a treatment could be better because the time passed and not because the treatment has a significant effect → longitudinal studies
3) **Mortality of the sample** = it is very difficult that all participants stay in the research for a long time → longitudinal studies

##### Single case studies

- They consist of the systematic study of a single subject who is particularly interesting
- Most of the single case studies concerns cases of neuropsychological disorders or mental illness. This is because in these situations is often difficult to collect samples of large sizes (e.g., rare disorders) and it is impossible to manipulate the variable to study (e.g., brain lesion)

#### Concepts to always keep in mind

```ad-warning
Always keep in mind : 
- Randomization and counterbalancing
- Sources of systematic variation
- Baseline
- Observer-expectancy effect
- Placebo effect
```

##### Randomization
Randomization = to randomly assign

We have to randomize : 
1) The **participants to the different experimental conditions** (for between subjects designs)
2) The **order of the different experimental conditions** (in within subjects experimental designs) = counterbalancing
3) The **order of the trials** when the experiment consists of exposing the subject to more than one stimulus

##### Possible source of systematic variation
- **Groups bias or selection error** = the sample of participants is not randomly taken from the population, so it could have some features that the experimenter is not controlling
- **Biased matching** = the experimental and the control groups are not identical for some variables (same age, same % of male and female, same educational level, etc.) that can influence the results
- **Practice effect** = participants may perform differently in the second condition because of familiarity with the experimental situation and/or the measures being used.
- **Boredom effect** = participants may perform differently in the second condition because they are tired or bored from having completed the first condition.
- **Primacy effect** = refers to the tendency to recall information presented at the start of a list better than information at the middle or end.
- **Recency effect** = refers to the tendency for people to more easily recall items that are presented last in a list.
##### Baseline
In psychological research the baseline is the starting level of the subject. 
You **should always collect it**, especially when you deal with physiological measures.

*Example :* 
*For example, in the clinical field, **the baseline is the measurement of the variable of interest at the beginning of treatment**. A clinical psychologist wants to see how effective a new type of therapy is for anxiety. For their study, they measure the anxiety levels of the participants by using a specific test that has been shown to be effective at measuring anxiety. The clinician then starts the new therapy method and uses the same anxiety measure every month and compares the scores to the baseline measurement in order to gauge its effectiveness as a treatment. If the participants' anxiety levels have been reduced from the baseline score, then the therapy could be said to be effective. If the anxiety levels are unchanged or higher, the clinician will not use this method in the future.*

##### Observer-expectancy effect

When the experimenter know the hypothesis and he/she expected some results, he/she involuntary influence the results.
- Unconsciously assigning participants to the different experimental conditions following a criteria
- having a different behaviour during data collection in each experimental condition (**clever Hans effect**)
- **Rosenthal effect (or Pygmalion effect)** is the phenomenon whereby others' expectations affect the target person's performance. A corollary of the Pygmalion effect is the golem effect, in which low expectations lead to a decrease in performance. Both effects are forms of self-fulfilling prophecy.
- **Confirmation bias** can lead to the experimenter interpreting results incorrectly because of the tendency to look for information that conforms to their hypothesis


How to avoid that ? By using a **double-blind experiments**

It is a testing procedure, designed to eliminate biased results, in which the identity of those receiving a test treatment is concealed from both administrators and subjects until after the study is completed


But not only the experimenter can biase the experiment, also the subject : 

**Hawthorne effect** = it is a type of bias that generates when the subject knows to be under
investigation. The expectations of the subjects may influence his/her performance

##### Placebo effect

**Placebo effect** = it is similar to the Hawthorne effect, but it refers to the effect of the expectations of the patient when he/she takes a treatment.
