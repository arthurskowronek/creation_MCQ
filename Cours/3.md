##### Central Nervous System structure (CNS)

![[Central nervous system (CNS) - image.png]]
##### Glia cells

- Non-neuronal cells of the CNS and PNS.
- Provide support, nourishment, remove waste products, maintain chemical balance (homeostasis), protection for neurons and for myelin.
- Do not transmit electrical impulse to neurons.
- Essential for the overall health and function of the nervous system

##### Structure and function of the neuron

The neurons are the **specialized cells of the nervous system**. 
- Each neuron has a specific role. 
- They transmit sensory information to the brain and send information to the body's muscles (motor neurons), performing the nervous functions that underlie processes of thinking, memory, emotions, and movement control.

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Neuron** : A type of cell that makes up the nervous system and supports, amongst other things, cognitive function.
- **Cell body** : Part of the neuron containing the nucleus and other organelles. The **nucleus** contains the genetic code, and this is involved in protein synthesis (e.g. of certain neurotransmitters).
- **Dendrites** : Branching structures that carry information from other neurons in close proximity. The number and structure of the dendritic branches can vary significantly depending on the type of neuron.
- **Axon** : A branching structure that carries information to other neurons and transmits an action potential. (several millimeters to a meter)
```

```ad-note
title:Notes
```

- Although neurons have the same basic structure and function, it is important to note that **there are some significant differences between different types of neurons** in terms of the spatial arrangements of the dendrites and axon.
- Neurons receive information from other neurons and **they make a "decision" about this information** (by changing their own activity) that can then be passed on to other neurons. 
- The axon may be divided into several branches called collaterals

```ad-question
title: How to activite a neuron ? Electrical currents
```

- Electrical currents are actively transmitted through axons **by an action potential**
- Electrical currents flow passively through dendrites and soma of neurons but **will initiate an action potential if their summed potential is strong enough** at the start of the axon (called the hillock).

![[schema neuron electrical - image.png]]

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Synapse** : The small gap between neurons in which neurotransmitters are released, permitting signaling between neurons. 
- The two neurons forming the synapse are referred to as **presynaptic** (before the synapse) and **postsynaptic** (after the synapse), reflecting the direction of information flow (from axon to dendrite). 
- **Action potential** : A sudden change (depolarization and repolarization) in the electrical properties of the neuron membrane in an axon.
- **Neurotransmitters** : Chemical signals that are released by one neuron and affect the properties of other neurons.
```

```ad-note
title:Notes
```

- **A small proportion of synapses**, such as retinal gap junctions, **signal electrically and not chemically**
- When a presynaptic neuron is active, an electrical current (termed an action potential) is propagated down the length of the axon. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, chemicals are released into the synaptic cleft. These chemicals are termed neurotransmitters.
- **Neurotransmitters bind to receptors** on the dendrites or cell body of the postsynaptic neuron **and create a synaptic potential.** 
- Dentrin size determines how strong the signal is

###### Electrical signaling and the action potential

```ad-attention
title:Barrier and gate-keepers in neurons
```

- Each neuron is **surrounded by a cell membrane that acts as a barrier** to the passage of certain chemicals.
- Within the membrane, **certain protein molecules act as gate-keepers** and allow particular chemicals in and out under certain conditions. These chemicals consist, amongst others, of charged sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions.

```ad-example
title:Voltage-Gated Channels and Action Potential Mechanism
```

![[Voltage-Gated Channels and Action Potential Mechanism 2 -  image.png]]

**Voltage-gated ion channels are of particular importance in the generation of an action potential.** 
They are found only in axons, which is why only the axon is capable of producing action potentials. 
The sequence of events is as follows :

- 1. If a **passive current of sufficient strength** flows across the axon membrane, this begins to **open the voltage-gated Na+ channels**.
- 2. When the channel is opened, then **Na+ may enter the cell** and the **negative potential normally found on the inside is reduced** (the **cell is said to** **depolarize**). At about -50 mV, the cell membrane becomes completely permeable and the charge on the inside of the cell momentarily reverses. This sudden depolarization and subsequent repolarization in electrical charge across the membrane is the **action potential**.
- 3. The **negative potential of the cell is restored** via the outward flow of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels and closing of the voltage-gated Na+ channels.
- 4. There is a **brief period in which hyperpolarization occurs** (the inside is more negative than at rest). This makes it more difficult for the axon to depolarize straight away and prevents the action potential from travelling backwards.

![[Electrical signaling and the action potential - image.png]]

```ad-note
title:Notes
```

- The balance between these ions on the inside and outside of the membrane is such that **there is normally a resting potential of -70 mV across the membrane** (the inside being negative relative to the outside).
- The **conduction of the action potential along the axon may be speeded up if the axon is myelinated.**
- The signal can **only go in one direction**

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Myelin** : A fatty substance that is deposited around the axon of some neurons that speeds conduction. It **blocks the normal Na+/K+ transfer** and so the action potential jumps, via passive conduction, down the length of the axon at the points at which the myelin is absent (called nodes of Ranvier).
```

Note : *Destruction of myelin is found in a number of pathologies, notably multiple sclerosis.*

###### How do neurons code information?

```ad-question
title:How do neurons code information?
```

- The amplitude of an action potential does not vary, but the **number of action potentials propagated per second varies along a continuum**. 
- This rate of responding (also called the "**spiking rate**") relates to the informational "code" carried by that neuron.

```ad-example
```

For example, some neurons may have a high spiking rate in some situations (e.g. during speech) but not others (e.g. during vision), whereas other neurons would have a complementary profile. 

```ad-note
```

Neurons responding to similar types of information tend to be grouped together. 
**->** This gives rise to the functional specialization of brain regions. 

```ad-question
title:If information is carried in the response rate of a neuron, what determines the type of information that the neuron responds to ? 
```

- The type of information that a neuron carries is **related to the input it receives** and the **output it sends** to other neurons. 

```ad-example
```

For example, the reason why neurons in the primary auditory cortex can be considered to carry information about sound is because they receive input from a pathway originating in the cochlea and they send information to other neurons involved in more advanced stages of auditory processing (e.g. speech perception). 

However, imagine that one were to re-wire the brain such that the primary auditory cortex was to receive inputs from the retinal pathway rather than the auditory pathway (e.g. Sur & Leamey, 2001). In this case, the function of the primary "auditory" cortex would have changed (as would the type of information it carries) even though the region itself was not directly modified (only the inputs to it were modified). 

This general point is worth bearing in mind when one considers what the function of a given region is. 
**The function of a region is determined by its inputs and outputs.** 
As such, the extent to which a function can be strictly localized is a moot point.

#### Brain structure

##### Gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid

**Neurons** are organized within the brain to **form white matter and gray matter.**

- The brain consists of a highly convoluted folded sheet of gray matter (the cerebral cortex), beneath which lies the white matter. 
- In the center of the brain, beneath the bulk of the white matter fibers, lies another collection of gray matter structures (the **subcortex**), which includes the basal ganglia, the limbic system and the diencephalon. (See : [[Cours Cognitive, behavioral and social data#The subcortex]])

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Gray matter** : Matter consisting primarily of neuronal cell bodies.
- **White matter** : Tissue of the nervous system consisting primarily of axons and support cells (glia).
```

```ad-note
title:3 types of white matter
```

**White matter tracts :** 
- may project between different cortical regions within the same hemisphere (called **association tracts**), 
- may project between different cortical regions in different hemispheres (called **commissures**; the most important commissure being the **corpus callosum**) 
- or may project between cortical and subcortical structures (called **projection tracts**).

| ![[Gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid - image.png]] | There are 3 different kinds of white matter tract,<br>depending on the nature of <br>the regions that are connected :<br>- association tract<br>- commissure<br>- projection tract |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Glia** : Support cells of the nervous system involved in tissue repair and in the formation of myelin (amongst other functions).
- **Corpus callosum** : A large white matter tract that connects the two hemispheres.
```

```ad-note
title:Ventricles
```

- The brain also contains a number of hollow chambers termed **ventricles**.
- These were incorrectly revered for 1500 years as being the seat of mental life. The ventricles are **filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**, which does serve some useful functions, albeit non-cognitive. The CSF carries waste metabolites, transfers some messenger signals and provides a protective cushion for the brain.

| ![[Gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid 2 - image.png]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The brain consists of **four ventricles** filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) : <br>- the lateral ventricles are found in each hemisphere, <br>- the third ventricle lies centrally around the subcortical structures, <br>- and the fourth ventricle lies in the brainstem (hindbrain). |

##### A hierarchical view of the central nervous system

**Brain evolution** can be thought of as **adding additional structures onto older ones**, rather than replacing older structures with newer ones. 

```ad-example
```

For example, the main visual pathway in humans travels from the retina to the occipital lobe, but a number of older visual pathways also exist and contribute to vision. 
These older pathways constitute the dominant form of seeing for other species such as birds and reptiles.

##### Terms of reference and section

There are conventional directions for navigating around the brain, just as there is a north, south, east and west for navigating around maps. 

| ![[Terms of reference and section 1 - image.png]] | ![[Terms of reference and section 2 - image.png]] |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

- **Anterior** and **posterior** refer to directions towards the front and the back of the brain, respectively. These are also called **rostral** and **caudal**, respectively, particularly in other species that have a tail (caudal refers to the tail end). 
- Directions towards the top and the bottom are referred to as **superior** and **inferior**, respectively; they are also known as **dorsal** and **ventral**, respectively. 
- The terms **lateral** and **media** are used to refer to directions towards the outer surface and the center of the brain, respectively. It is called "medial" because it lies midway between the superior and inferior temporal gyri.
- The brain can be sectioned into two-dimensional slices in a number of ways. A **coronal cross-section** refers to a slice in the vertical plane through both hemispheres (the brain appcars roundish in this section). A **sagittal section** refers to a slice in the vertical plane going through one of the hemispheres. 
- When the sagittal section lies between the hemispheres it is called a **midline** (or medial) **section**. An **axial** (or horizontal) **section** is taken in the horizontal plane.
##### 10 interesting facts about the human brain

- 1 - **There are 100 billion neurons in the human brain.**
- 2 - **Each neuron may connect with around 10,000 other neurons.**
- 3 - **If each neuron connected with every single other neuron, our brain would be 12.5 miles in diameter** (Nelson & Bower, 1990). This is the length of Manhattan Island. This leads to an important conclusion - namely, that neurons only connect with a small subset of other neurons. Neurons may tend to communicate only with their neighbors and long-range connections are the exception rather than the ruie.
- 4 - Neurons make up only of the cells in our brain. This may have given rise to the common myth that we only ever use of our brain (Beyerstein, 1999). The other cells are called glia and they serve a number of essential support functions. For example, they are involved in tissue repair and in the formation of myelin.
- 5 - The brain makes up only 2% of body weight.
- 6 - It is no longer believed that neurons in the brain are incapable of being regenerated. It was once widely believed that we are born with our full complement of neurons and that new neurons are not generated. This idea is now untenable, at least in a region called the dentate gyrus (for a review, see Gross, 2000).
- 7 - **On average, we lose a net amount of one cortical neuron per second.** A Study has shown that around 10% of our cortical neurons perish between the ages of 20 and 90 years - equivalent to 85,000 neurons per day (Pakkenberg & Gundersen, 1997).
- 8 - Identical twins do not have anatomically identical brains. A comparison of identical and non-identical twins suggests that the three-dimensional cortical gyral pattern is determined primarily by non-genetic factors, although brain size is strongly heritable (Bartley, Jones, & Weinberger. 1997).
- 9 - Autistic people have larger brains (Abell et al., 1999). They also have larger heads to accommodate them. There is unlikely to be a simple relationship between brain size and intellect (most autistic people have low IQ) and brain efficiency may be unrelated to size.
- 10 - **Men have larger brains than women**, **but women have more folded brains**. The total number of cortical neurons is related to gender but not overall height or weight (Pakkenberg & Gundersen, 1997). The female brain is more folded, implying an increase in surface area that may offset any size difference (Luders et al., 2004).

#### The cerebral cortex

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- The **cerebral cortex** consists of two folded sheets of gray matter organized into two hemispheres (left and right). The cortex contains **gyri** and **sulci**.
- **Gyri** (gyrus = singular) : The raised folds of the cortex.
- **Sulci** (sulcus = singular) : The buried grooves of the cortex.
```

```ad-note
```

- Having a folded structure permits a high surface area to volume ratio and thereby permits efficient packaging. 
- The cortex is only around 3 mm thick

```ad-question
title:Organization of the cortex
```

- The cortex is organized into **different layers** that can be seen when viewed in cross-section. 
- The **different layers reflect the grouping of different cell types**. 

- Most of the cortex contains **six main cortical layers** and this is termed the **neocortex** (meaning "new cortex"). 
- Other cortical regions are the **mesocortex** (including the cingulate gyrus and insula) and the **allocortex** (including the primary olfactory cortex and hippocampus).
- The lateral surface of the cortex of **each hemisphere is divided into four lobes** : **the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes**. 
	- The dividing line between the lobes is sometimes prominent, as is the case between the frontal and temporal lobes (divided by the lateral or sylvian fissure), but in other cases the boundary cannot readily be observed (e.g. between temporal and occipital lobes). 
- Finally, an island of cortex lies buried underneath the temporal lobe; this is called the **insula** (which literally means "island" in Latin).

![[The cerebral cortex - image.png]]

![[Organization of the cortex - image.png]]

```ad-example
title:Different ways to divide regions
```

There are three different ways in which regions of cerebral cortex may be divided and, hence, labeled :
- I. **Regions divided by the pattern of gyri and sulci.** The same pattern of gyri and sulci is found in everyone (although the precise shape and size varies greatly). As such, it is possible to label different regions of the brain accordingly.
- II. **Regions divided by cytoarchitecture.** One of the most influential ways of dividing up the cerebral cortex is in terms of **Brodmann's areas.** Brodmann divided the cortex up into approximately 52 areas (labeled from BAI to BA52), based on the relative distribution of cell types across cortical layers. Areas are labeled in a circular spiral starting from the middle, like the numbering system of Parisian suburbs. Over the years, the map has been modified.
- III. **Regions divided by junction.** This method tends only to be used for primary sensory and motor areas. For example, Brodmann areas 17 and 6 are also termed the primary visual cortex and the primary motor cortex, respectively. Higher cortical regions are harder (if not impossible) to ascribe unique functions to.

#### The subcortex

Beneath the cortical surface and the intervening white matter lies another collection of gray maller nuclei termed the **subcortex**. The subcortex is typically divided into a number of different systems with different evolutionary and functional histories.
##### The basal ganglia

The **basal ganglia** are large munded masses that lie in each hemisphere. 
They surround and overhang the thalamus in the center of the brain. 

![[the basal gaglia 2 - image.png]]

```ad-note
title:Roles
```

They are involved in :
- **regulating motor activity** 
- and the **programming and termination of action**. 

The basal ganglia are also **implicated in the learning of skills and habits**. 

```ad-check
title:Structure
```

The main structures comprising the basal ganglia are :
- the **caudate nucleus** (an elongated tail-like structure), 
- the **putamen** (lying more laterally) 
- and the **globus pallidus** (lying more medially). 

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Brodmann's areas** : Regions of cortex defined by the relative distribution of cell types across cortical layers (cytoarchitecture).
- **Basal ganglia** : Regions of subcortical gray matter involved in aspects of motor control and skill learning; they consist of structures such as the caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus.
```

![[The basal ganglia - image.png]]

##### The limbic system

![[The limbic system  2 - image.png]]

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Limbic system** : A region of subcortex involved in relating the organism to its environment based on current needs and the present situation, and based on previous experience. Limbic structures include the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate cortex and mamillary bodies.
```

```ad-note
title:Roles
```

- It is involved in the **detection and expression of emotional responses**. 
	**->** For example, the amygdala has been implicated in the detection of fearful or threatening stimuli and parts of the cingulate gyrus have been implicated in the detection of emotional and cognitive conflicts.

- The hippocampus is particularly **important for learning and memory** and has also been hypothesized to act as a **novelty detector** (e.g. Knight, 1996). 

- The mamillary bodies are two small round protrusions that have traditionally been implicated in **memory** (e.g. Dusoir, Kapur, Byrnes, McKinstry, & Hoare, 1990). 

```ad-success
title:Where
```

Both the **amygdala** and **hippocampus** lie buried **in the temporal lobes of each hemisphere**. 
**Other** limbic structures are clearly **visible on the underside (ventral surface) of the brain**. 

The **olfactory bulbs** lie on the **under surface of the frontal lobes**. 
Their connections to the limbic system underscore the importance of smell for detecting environmentally salient stimuli (e.g. food, other animals) and its influence on mood and memory.

![[The limbic system - image.png]]

##### The diencephalon

The **two main structures that make up the diencephalon** are the thalamus and the hypothalamus.

![[The diencephalon  3- image.png]]

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
- **Thalamus** : A major subcortical relay center; for instance, it is a processing station between all sensory organs (except smell) and the cortex.
- **Hypothalamus** : Consists of a variety of nuclei that are specialized for different functions that are prirnarily concerned with the body and its regulation.
```

```ad-example
title:Thalamus
```

The thalamus consists of **two interconnected egg-shaped masses** that lie in the center of the brain and appear prominent in a medial section. 

- The thalamus is the **main sensory relay for all senses** (except smell) between the sense organs (eyes, ears, etc.) and the cortex. 
- At the posterior end of the thalamus lie the lateral geniculate nucleus and the media/geniculate nucleus. These are the main sensory relays to the primary visual and primary auditory cortices, respectively.

```ad-example
title:Hypothalamus
```

The hypothalamus lies beneath the thalamus and consists of a **variety of nuclei that are specialized for different functions primarily concerned with the body.** 
- These include **body temperature**, **hunger and thirst**, **sexual activity** and r**egulation of endocrine functions** (e.g. regulating body growth).

##### The midbrain and hindbrain

The **midbrain region** consists of a number of structures :

- The **superior colliculi** and **inferior colliculi** (or colliculus in singular) are gray-matter nuclei. 
	- The superior colliculi integrate information from several senses (vision, hearing and touch), whereas the inferior colliculi are specialized for auditory processing.
	- These pathways are difTerent from the main cortical sensory pathways and are evolutionarily older. They may provide a fast route that enables rapid orienting to stimuli (flashes or bangs) before the stimulus is consciously scen or heard (e.g. Sparks, 1999). 
- The midbrain also contains a region called the **substantia nigro**, which is connected to the basal ganglia.
	- Cell loss in this region is associated with the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
- The **cerebellum** (literally "little brain") is attached to the posterior of the hindbrain via the cerebellar peduncles. It consists of highly convoluted folds of gray matter. It is organized into two interconnected lobes. The cerebellum is **important for dexterity and smooth execution of movement.** This function may be achieved by integrating motor commands with online sensory feedback about the current state of the action. 
	- Unilateral lesions to the cerebellum result in poor coordination on the same side of the body as the lesion (i.e. ipsilesional side). 
	- Bilateral lesions result in a Wide and staggering gait, slurred speech (dysarthria) and eyes moving in a to-and-fro motion (nystagmus). 
- The **pons** is a key link between the cerebellum and the cerebrum. It receives information from visual areas to control eye and body movements. 
- The **medulla oblongata** protrudes from the pons and merges with the spinal cord. It regulates vital functions such as breathing, swallowing, heart rate and the wake-sleep cycle.

```ad-abstract
title:Some definitions
-  **Superior colliculi** : A midbrain nucleus that forms part of a subcortical sensory pathway involved in programming fast eye movements.
- **Inferior colliculi** : A midbrain nucleus that forms part of a subcortical auditory pathway.
- **Cerebellum** : Structure attached to the hindbrain; important for dexterity and smooth execution of movement.
- **Pons** : Part of the hindbrain; a key link between the cerebellum and the cerebrum.
- **Medulla oblongata** : Part of the hindbrain; it regulates vital functions such as breathing, swallowing, heart rate and the wake-sleep cycle.

	**->** Morphological: The structure of the presynaptic and/or postsynaptic element is modified.
Sprouting : 
	**->** Proliferation of axon collaterals resulting in the formation of synapses. Neurons near the lesion that survived the initial insult begin to emit "sprouts." The result is the growth of nerve fibers that reach new cellular endings.
Neurogenesis :
	**->** Postnatal proliferation of certain populations of brain neurons: Stem cells (primitive, unspecialized cells with the unique ability to transform into any other type of cell in the body).

##### Homunculus

**Visual representation of the body based on the amount of brain area dedicated to different body parts**, particularly in the somatosensory and motor cortex of the brain.

##### Cortical remapping after peripheral injury 

Cutting a sensory nerve or amputating a part of the body selectively deprived the corresponding cortical representation (somatotopically organized).

However, it was found that **the deprived cortical area does not remain inactive but reorganizes itself**. This reorganization allows the affected area to become the new cortical representation for adjacent body areas.

Neurons can communicate non-synaptically by releasing diffusing gases (nitric oxide, NO).
- NO (nitric oxide) is produced by specific neurons and **diffuses in all directions** into a volume of the brain, **potentially affecting many other neurons** and synapses in the surrounding area.
- GasNet **one neuron can affect another without actually being “synaptically” connected to it.** They include synaptic wiring like conventional ANN, but they also simulate gaseous modulatory communication.
