#### From EEG to BCI

- In 1929, Hans Berger, a German neuropsychiatrist, recorded the first EEG.
- Berger also discovered the alpha rhythm, an oscillation in the 8-12 Hz frequency spectrum; it originates in the occipital lobe, and it is usually associated with relaxed waking states with closed eyes.
- In 1968, Joseph Kamiya showed that the alpha rhythm can be conditioned: people can learn to discriminate between its presence and absence. Using a feedback mechanism, people can learn to change the frequency of the alpha rhythm.
- This work is usually considered the stating point of the era of neurofeedback, which in turn influenced the idea of using brain activity to control an external device (brain-computer interface devices).

#### Neurofeedback

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- **Neurofeedback** is the process of using information obtained from online brain activity to allow a subject to self-regulate a task. It is a kind of biofeedback, which teaches self-control of brain functions to subjects by measuring brain waves and providing a feedback signal.
```

- Neurofeedback usually provides the audio and or video feedback.
- Positive or negative feedback is produced for desirable or undesirable brain activities, respectively.

```ad-example
title:Possible clinical applications
```

- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Schizophrenia
- Epilepsy
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Anxiety disorders
- Depression

#### Brain-computer interface

```ad-abstract
title:Definition
- A **brain-computer interface** is a communication system independent of the normal communication pathways of the brain that use peripheral nerves and muscles
- A **BCI-based device** is a computer-based system that acquires brain signals, analyzes them, and translates them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry out the desired action.
```

- In BCI, neuromuscular activity is not required for the production of a message.

```ad-hint
title:Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices
```

A brain computer interface (BCI) device is a hardware and software communications system that :
- enables humans to interact with the environment
- by using control signals generated from electroencephalographic activity
- without the involvement of peripheral nerves and muscles

![[BCI - image.png]]

```ad-note
title:BCI components
```

To build a BCI system, the following components are generally needed:
- 1. signal acquisition during a specific experimental paradigm
- 2. data pre-processing
- 3. feature extraction (e.g., P300 amplitude, SSVEP, or alpha/beta bands)
- 4. classification (detection) à machine learning can be applied at this stage to recognize the pattern of neural activation
- 5. translation of the classification result to commands (BCI applications) and user feedback

#### EEG reading: recognition of neural pattern activation using ML

```ad-example
title:Example of classification problems on EEG data
```

- Deciding if a subject is thinking of moving his left or right hand
- Emotion recognition (different emotions may generate different EEG signals)

```ad-attention
title:**Problem** : data is not in vector form, but it’s a set of waves (one for each sensor) that you need to process data transforming waves into vectors (e.g., Fourier Transform)
```

```ad-info
title:BCI approaches
```

**Invasive approach :**
Intracranial recordings of neural electrical activity, made directly on a set of neurons or on single neurons. It needs a surgical implantation of electrodes in the brain, at the cortical or intracortical level.

**Non-invasive approach :**
Neural activity is recorded from the outside, thanks to functional techniques like EEG (electrodes are placed on the scalp).

```ad-hint
title:Non-invasive BCI paradigms
```

In general, there are two types of BCIs :
- **Active** (or spontaneous) BCIs are controlled via endogenous tasks such as motor imagery (MI) or mental operations (e.g., imaginary rotation of 3D objects or mental arithmetic operations). These are based on recording slow potential shifts and variations of rhythmic activity due to internal tasks.
- **Reactive** (or evoked or passive) BCIs exploit external stimulation (auditory, visual, haptic). They are based on the detection of the evoked potentials, especially P300 and SSVEP, which reflect the immediate automatic responses of the brain to some external stimuli.

```ad-note
Among the many BCI paradigms, motor imagery, P300 and SSVEP are the most common.
```

#### BCI potential users

```ad-example
title:Example of P300 BCI: the P300 Speller
```

| - The oddball paradigm is implemented<br>- The subject is presented with a matrix where there are letters, numbers and other symbols<br>- Every column and row of this matrix is intensified randomly (e.g., changing colour)<br>- When the subject wants to communicate, he/she focuses the attention on a single cell (e.g., the letter D)<br>- In this way, the content of the cell becomes relevant and rare, evoking a P300 | ![[Example of P300 BCI - the P300 Speller - image.png]] |

```ad-success
title:BCI devices clinical applications
```

BCI technology have two principal clinical purposes :
- **Compensation** (assistive BCIs) : devices to assist people in daily life activities
	- Communication
	- Controlling physical devices
- **Rehabilitation** (rehabilitative BCIs) : the brain-machine interface could facilitate neuroplasticity, thus enhancing motor learning and motor recovery

```ad-question
title:Who are assistive BCI potential users ?
```

People totally paralyzed or with a severe motor impairment, which can also compromise their ability to communicate.

This condition can be due to syndromes and degenerative diseases, such as:
- Guillain-Barré syndrome
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
- brainstem infarction
- traumatic or metabolic brain syndromes

```ad-info
title:Locked-in syndrome (LIS)
```

Plum and Posner (1966) defined the locked-in syndrome (LIS) as a condition that consists of tetraplegia and anarthria leading to a state of complete paralysis, but without affecting the intellectual abilities.

There are three stages of LIS:
- 1. **Incomplete LIS** : in addition to eye movements there are also other voluntary residual movements, such as for example the control of a finger or some facial muscles, which can therefore be used as a communication channel.
- 2. **LIS** : patients retain the ability of eye movement, which can sometimes be used to communicate.
- 3. **Total (or complete) LIS** : in this stage there is no longer any residual movement, including eye movements, and the patient is in a state of complete immobility.

Due to their inability to communicate, the condition of these patients may be misdiagnosed as a vegetative state.
Literature reports cases of LIS patients who were recognized as conscious only several years after the onset of the paralytic condition.
Patients with a stable LIS condition and with adequate medical care can have a life expectancy of up to several decades.
