#### Anatomy and Functions of the Retina

```ad-note
title:Résumé :
Cette section explique la structure de la rétine, où les photorécepteurs (cônes et bâtonnets) captent la lumière et initient le processus de vision. Les cellules ganglionnaires jouent un rôle essentiel en transmettant les signaux visuels de la rétine au cerveau. Elle introduit aussi les notions de champs récepteurs, où certaines cellules répondent uniquement aux stimuli lumineux dans des régions spécifiques (zones ON/OFF).
```

The retina is a complex, light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye where visual processing begins. It contains different types of cells that work together to detect and transmit light information to the brain.
##### Photoreceptors (cones and rods)

- **Rods** are specialized for low-light conditions and allow us to see shades of gray in dim lighting. They are primarily responsible for night vision and are highly sensitive to changes in light intensity.
- **Cones** are responsible for color vision and function best in well-lit conditions. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light (red, green, and blue), enabling us to perceive a range of colors.

##### Ganglion cells, receptive field

- **Ganglion cells** receive signals from photoreceptors through intermediate cells and play a crucial role in forming the optic nerve, which carries visual information to the brain.
- Each ganglion cell has a **receptive field**, a specific region of the retina from which it receives input.

##### Action potentials and ON/OFF receptive fields

- Ganglion cells respond to light stimuli with action potentials (electrical impulses) that vary based on the location of light in their receptive field.
- **Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potentials (EPSP)** increase the likelihood of neuron firing, while **Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potentials (IPSP)** reduce neuron firing.
- This **ON/OFF organization** helps detect contrast and movement in the visual field, allowing the brain to process edges and shapes accurately.

```ad-hint
title:Ganglion receptive fields
```

Two kinds of visual responses: ON and OFF :
- **ON response** : neuron fires more rapidly when light shown and stops firing at offset of light
- **OFF response** : neuron stops firing when light is shown and starts firing at the offset of ligh

![[Ganglion receptive fields - image.png]]

Rather than a single spot, a region with concentric ON and OFF responses
ON and OFF regions are spatially separate.

```ad-note
Some ganglion cells respond to light in the center of their receptive field and not their sorround.

Others in reverse, so they respond to light in the outer circle and to darkness in the inner circle.

Thus distinguished two classes of ganglion cells: 
- **those center-on** 
- **those center-off**
```

#### Visual Pathways and Their Functions

```ad-note
title:Résumé :
On y explore le parcours des informations visuelles de la rétine au cortex visuel via le noyau géniculé latéral (LGN). Ce trajet, appelé voie géniculo-striée, se termine dans le cortex visuel primaire (V1) où les informations sont traitées pour reconnaître des segments visuels simples. L'organisation rétinotopique est abordée, expliquant comment le cortex visuel est structuré pour représenter l'espace visuel. Ce chapitre introduit également le concept de **blindsight**, où certains patients, bien que diagnostiqués aveugles, montrent une capacité inconsciente de discrimination visuelle.
```

##### Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) and geniculostriate pathway

The **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)** is a key relay center in the brain that receives visual information from the retina and transmits it to the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe. This pathway, called the **geniculostriate pathway**, is critical for visual perception. The LGN is composed of six layers, three for each eye, and each cell within the LGN has a center-surround receptive field. These cells respond to differences in light within their receptive fields and function similarly to ganglion cells found in the retina.

![[Psy - Lateral Geniculate Nucleus 1 - image.png]]

- Number of different pathways from eye to brain
- Route called geniculostriate pathway because it goes via lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and terminates in striate cortex
- The LGN is a relay nucleus that receives visual information from the retina and transmits it to the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe 

![[Psy - Lateral Geniculate Nucleus 2 - image.png]]

- Two LGNs. Contains six layers, three for each eye
- Cells have a center-surround receptive field
- They respond to differences in light across their receptive field
- One cell can only detect one of the squares: light sensitive area or the receptive field of the cell.
- Same properties as ganglion cells (as discovered by Kuffler)

```ad-abstract
title:Hubel and Wiesel theory
```

Hubel and Wiesel's theory explains how the visual system processes and interprets visual information, especially through cells in the primary visual cortex. 
They discovered that certain neurons, called "simple cells," respond specifically to edges or bars of light oriented in particular directions, rather than to single points of light. These simple cells receive input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), combining responses to form more complex patterns. Further up, "complex cells" respond to these patterns, processing motion and orientation regardless of exact location within the receptive field. 
This hierarchical organization suggests that the brain assembles visual information in layers, from basic elements like edges to more complex structures, contributing to how we recognize shapes, movement, and spatial relationships. Hubel and Wiesel's work won them a Nobel Prize in 1981, as it provided fundamental insights into visual perception.

##### Primary Visual Cortex (V1)

The **primary visual cortex (V1)**, located in the occipital lobe, is where visual information first arrives for cortical processing. Neurons in V1 respond primarily to simple visual stimuli, such as lines or edges at specific orientations. When scientists first recorded from cells in the primary visual cortex, they observed that these cells did not respond to small spots of light but rather to line segments or edges. This indicates that V1 neurons are specialized for detecting orientation and spatial patterns.

![[Psy- Primary Visual Cortex (V1) - image.png]]

- Extracts basic information from the visual scene (e.g. edges, orientations, wavelength of light)
- This information is used by later stages of processing to extract information about shape, color, movement, etc

##### Retinotopic organization and concepts of cortical blindness (Blindsight)

V1 is organized in a **retinotopic** manner, meaning the spatial layout of light on the retina is preserved in the response properties of V1 neurons. This organization allows for a spatial representation of the visual field within V1. If an area of V1 is damaged, it can lead to blindness in the corresponding region of the visual field, known as **hemianopia**. Despite this cortical blindness, some patients exhibit **blindsight**, where they cannot consciously perceive objects in the "blind" area but retain some unconscious visual abilities, such as detecting motion or orientation. This phenomenon suggests that additional, non-conscious pathways also carry visual information to other brain areas.

```ad-note
title:Spatial arrangement of primary visual cortex (V1)
```

- **Retinotopic organization** – the spatial arrangement of light on the retina is retained in the response properties of V1 neurons (except inverted)
- Damage to parts of area V1 results in blindness for the corresponding region of space (e.g. hemianopia)
- Visual cortex is spatially organized 
- if you damage your primary visual cortex you would be cortically blinded

![[Psy - Spatial arrangement of primary visual cortex - image.png]]

```ad-info
title:Blindsight
```

- Damage to V1 leads to a clinical diagnosis of blindness (the patient cannot consciously report objects presented in this region of space)
- However, the patient is still able to make some visual discriminations in the "blind" area (e.g. orientation, movement direction)

#### Dorsal and Ventral Visual Pathways

```ad-note
title:Résumé :
Cette partie distingue deux voies principales dans le traitement visuel au-delà du cortex primaire : la voie dorsale, impliquée dans la localisation des objets dans l’espace et dans la navigation, et la voie ventrale, dédiée à la reconnaissance et à l’identification des objets. Elle souligne comment chaque voie contribue différemment à notre perception du monde visuel.
```

**Dorsal Pathway ("Where" Pathway)**:
- Function : Responsible for spatial awareness and navigation.
- Purpose : Helps in identifying the location of objects in space and in coordinating movement to interact with those objects.
- Associated Actions : Often referred to as the "doing and handling" pathway, this pathway is crucial for understanding spatial relationships and guiding actions, such as reaching for or moving around objects.

**Ventral Pathway ("What" Pathway)**:
- Function : Involved in object recognition and identification.
- Purpose : Focuses on analyzing the characteristics of an object to recognize and categorize it (e.g., determining if it’s a face, a tool, or a piece of food).
- Associated Actions : Often called the "naming and knowing" pathway, as it allows for the association of visual information with meaning, names, and stored knowledge about objects.

#### Motion Perception and Area V5/MT

```ad-note
title:Résumé :
Cette section se concentre sur l'aire V5/MT, une région cérébrale spécialisée dans la perception du mouvement. Les neurones de cette zone répondent préférentiellement aux mouvements dans des directions spécifiques, ce qui nous permet de percevoir des objets en déplacement. Elle mentionne aussi des conditions telles que l'akinetopsie, où des patients voient le monde en une série d'images fixes à cause de dommages bilatéraux dans cette région.
```

##### Experiment on Motion Perception

- An experiment presented subjects with two types of visual stimuli:
    - **Static stimulus**: stationary black-and-white squares.
    - **Moving stimulus**: black-and-white squares moving in different directions.
- **Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)** was measured to observe differences in brain activity between static and moving images.
- Results showed increased activation in V5/MT when subjects viewed the moving stimulus, indicating its role in motion processing.
##### Role of Area V5/MT in Motion Perception

- Area V5, also known as the middle temporal area (MT), is specialized for processing motion.
- Neurons in V5/MT are highly responsive to the direction and speed of moving objects, but not to color.
- Approximately 90% of V5/MT cells are direction-sensitive, meaning they fire in response to movement in a specific direction.
- This region allows for the perception of smooth, continuous movement in the visual field.

##### Akinetopsia

- Damage to both sides of the V5/MT area can lead to **akinetopsia**, or "motion blindness."
- Patients with akinetopsia perceive the world as a series of still images, like a strobe light effect, rather than as continuous movement.
- Despite this deficit, these patients can detect movement through other senses (e.g., hearing or touch) but lack the visual ability to perceive smooth transitions in movement.

#### Object Recognition and Gestalt Model

```ad-note
title:Résumé :
Le processus de reconnaissance des objets est présenté en plusieurs étapes, de la perception des caractéristiques visuelles de base à l'association de ces éléments en objets complets grâce aux principes de Gestalt. La section inclut des exemples de troubles visuels comme l'agnosie, où les patients peuvent percevoir des formes mais échouent à identifier les objets.
```

##### Steps of object recognition

1. **Early Visual Processing**: The initial stage involves basic visual processing, where the brain detects simple attributes like color, motion, edges, and orientation. This is the foundation for understanding more complex features.
2. **Grouping Visual Elements**: At this stage, visual elements are combined based on **Gestalt principles**, which describe how the mind organizes sensory information into whole forms. These principles include:
    - **Proximity**: Elements that are close together are perceived as part of the same object.
    - **Similarity**: Similar elements are grouped together, creating patterns or coherent shapes.
    - **Continuity**: The brain prefers to perceive continuous patterns rather than abrupt changes.
    - **Closure**: We mentally "fill in" gaps to create a complete, recognizable image.
    - **Figure-Ground Segmentation**: Distinguishing an object (the figure) from its background.
3. **Matching with Stored Representations**: Once visual elements are grouped, the brain matches these grouped elements to stored mental representations of objects. This comparison occurs in the **ventral pathway** and allows for recognition based on previously learned shapes and forms.
4. **Assigning Meaning**: The final stage involves attaching meaning to the recognized object, retrieving semantic knowledge (like object names and functions) from memory. This is essential for interpreting and interacting with objects in a meaningful way.

##### Disorders related to object recognition

Disorders in this process can lead to various forms of **agnosia**, where individuals may see an object but are unable to recognize or interpret it. Types of agnosia include:

- **Apperceptive Agnosia**: A deficit in perceiving the visual form of objects, often preventing individuals from recognizing shapes or copying simple drawings.
- **Associative Agnosia**: A deficit in linking a perceived object to its meaning, allowing patients to draw or copy an object without identifying it.
- **Prosopagnosia**: Often called "face blindness," this condition specifically affects the recognition of faces, even though other objects may be recognized without difficulty.

#### Color Perception and Area V4

```ad-note
title:Résumé :
Cette partie aborde la perception des couleurs, mettant en avant le rôle de l’aire V4 dans le cerveau. Contrairement aux autres régions sensibles à la lumière, V4 est impliquée dans la constance des couleurs, permettant à notre cerveau de percevoir une couleur cohérente malgré les variations d'éclairage. On y discute également de l'achromatopsie corticale, où des lésions entraînent une perte de la perception des couleurs malgré une rétine intacte.
```

##### Experiments on Color Perception

- In studies of color perception, researchers often expose subjects to two types of stimuli:
    - **Colored stimuli:** abstract compositions made of multicolored geometric shapes.
    - **Gray-scale stimuli:** the same shapes in shades of gray, matching the brightness of the colored shapes.
- By measuring **regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)**, researchers compare brain activity during colored and gray-scale viewing, which reveals V4's involvement in color processing.
##### Role of Area V4 in Color Perception

- Area V4 is a region in the brain specialized for color processing.
- Unlike other visual areas sensitive to light, V4 plays a key role in **color constancy** – the brain's ability to perceive consistent colors under varying lighting conditions.
- This mechanism allows us to identify colors accurately, despite changes in light source (e.g., daylight vs. artificial light).

##### Color Constancy Mechanism

- Color constancy enables the brain to compensate for different wavelengths of light, which can affect the perceived color of an object.
- For instance, an object perceived as red in daylight will still appear red under electric lighting, due to V4's adjustment for changes in illumination.

![[Psy - Color Constancy Mechanism - image.png]]

##### Cortical Achromatopsia

- Damage to Area V4 can result in **cortical achromatopsia**, a condition where individuals lose the ability to perceive color.
- Patients with cortical achromatopsia view the world in shades of gray, even though their retinas and V1 cells still respond to different wavelengths.
- This loss illustrates that color perception is more than just detecting wavelengths; it involves complex processing in V4

#### Agnosias and Visual Disorders

```ad-note
title:Résumé :
Cette section explore divers troubles visuels où la reconnaissance et l’identification d’objets sont altérées, même si la perception visuelle de base est intacte. Par exemple, l'agnosie apperceptive empêche les patients de percevoir correctement les formes, tandis que l'agnosie associative leur permet de copier un objet mais non de le reconnaître. Un autre exemple est la prosopagnosie, un trouble de la reconnaissance des visages.
```

##### Definition of Agnosia :

- Agnosia refers to a category of disorders where an individual has difficulty recognizing or identifying objects, people, or sounds, despite having intact sensory functioning. This impairment often arises from brain damage in specific areas that process perception and recognition.

##### Types of Visual Agnosia :
  
 - **Apperceptive Agnosia**: 
    - Individuals with apperceptive agnosia struggle to perceive and organize visual information correctly, leading to an inability to form a coherent image of an object.
    - Even though they can detect basic visual properties like color and brightness, they are unable to distinguish complex shapes or objects.
- **Associative Agnosia**:   
	   - In associative agnosia, individuals can perceive and even copy objects accurately but fail to link this perceptual information to stored knowledge, meaning they cannot recognize what the object is.
    - This form of agnosia often preserves other recognition abilities, such as recognizing objects through touch, indicating a specific impairment in visual-knowledge linkage.
##### Face Recognition Disorder (Prosopagnosia) :

  - **Prosopagnosia (Face Blindness)**:
    - Prosopagnosia is a specific form of agnosia affecting face recognition, where patients are unable to recognize familiar faces, even those of close family members or friends.
    - Despite the difficulty in face identification, individuals with prosopagnosia may recognize people by other cues, such as voice, clothing, or hairstyle.
     - This disorder illustrates a dissociation between facial processing and other visual recognition functions.

##### Neuroanatomical Basis :

- Agnosias and visual disorders often result from damage to regions within the occipital and temporal lobes, areas involved in high-level visual processing and object recognition.
 - Different forms of agnosia can reflect disruptions in various visual processing stages or pathways, such as:
       - The **ventral pathway** (what pathway), responsible for object recognition, including faces and shapes.
    - The **dorsal pathway** (where pathway), more related to spatial awareness and object localization.

##### Clinical Implications and Assessments :

- Diagnosing types of agnosia involves visual tests that distinguish between different recognition processes (e.g., recognizing objects by touch vs. sight).
- Understanding the distinctions between agnosia types provides insight into how visual perception and memory are interconnected and can be selectively impaired by neurological damage.
